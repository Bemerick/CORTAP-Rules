Disclosure is not required for activities performed by the recipient's own regularly employed officers and employees. Covered Federal action means the awarding of any federal contract, the making of any Federal grant, the making of any Federal loan, the entering into of any federal cooperative agreement, and the extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of any Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement. Each person must file a certification and disclosure form (as required) with each submission that initiates agency consideration of such person for, or upon receipt by such person of:\n\n• An award of any Federal contract, grant, or cooperative agreement exceeding $100,000;\n• An award of a Federal loan or a commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan exceeding $150,000; or\n• An amendment to such an award requiring FTA's and the recipient's execution in TrAMS.\n\nUpdates to OMB Standard Form LLL disclosures are required for each calendar quarter in which any event occurs that requires disclosure, or that materially affects the accuracy of the information contained in any disclosure form previously filed by the entity. Those events may include:\n\n• A cumulative increase of $25,000 or more in the amount paid or expected to be paid for influencing or attempting to influence a \"covered Federal action\"\n• A change in the person(s) or individual(s) attempting to influence a covered Federal action\n• A change in the officer(s), employee(s), or member(s) contacted to attempt to influence a covered Federal action\n\nAny subrecipient, contractor, and subcontractor in receipt of an award or contract exceeding $100,000 is subject to the same disclosure and updating requirements as the recipient.

For subrecipients and contractors selected for a site visit, review the applicable agreements and contracts to verify required lobbying disclosures and certifications were obtained.

See also §200.306 Cost sharing or matching paragraph (b).\n\n(g) Be adequately documented. See also §§200.300 Statutory and national policy requirements through 200.309 Period of performance of this part.\n\n(h) Cost must be incurred during the approved budget period.\n\n2 CFR Part 200 also identifies that recipients' written financial management policies and procedures must address Cash Management and Payment in accordance with 2 CFR 200.305 Federal payment.\n\n• For states with major Federal programs, payments are governed by Treasury-State Cash Management Improvement Act of 1990 (CMIA) agreements and default procedures codified at 31 CFR Part 205 \"Rules and Procedures for Efficient Federal-State Funds Transfers\" and the Treasury Financial Manual, Part 4A, Chapter 2000 (TFM 4A-2000) Overall Disbursing Rules for All Federal Agencies.\n\ni. The CMIA provides the general rules and procedures for the efficient transfer of funds for Federal financial assistance programs between the Federal government and the states. The CMIA requires an annual Treasury-State Agreement (TSA) between the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Financial Management Service and each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the Territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. The objectives of the agreement are (1) To minimize the time between the transfer of funds to the states and the payout for program purposes; (2) To ensure that Federal funds are available when requested; and (3) To assess an interest liability to the Federal government and/or the states to compensate for the lost value of funds. TSA covers Federal programs that meet the funding threshold established each year and establishes the procedures and requirements for the transfer of funds. These procedures require the state to calculate Federal and state interest liabilities at the Treasury bill rate for covered programs and to annually report the liabilities to the Federal government. Any interest owed by the state for the preceding fiscal year is due to the Federal government no later than March 31 of the following fiscal year.\n\nFor a State entity without a TSA, it is sufficient for the State to refer to the default procedures in 31 CFR 305(a). This is one instance where written procedures are not required, because the default procedures in 31 CFR 305(a) are very prescriptive. It is not necessary for the State to cut and paste the default procedures into their written materials. Note: This guidance is relevant only to state agencies whose transit program is not covered by the states' TSA and does not apply to non-state recipients.\n\nii. TFM 4A-2000 provides guidance to Federal agencies on the overall disbursing rules with the principal objectives of control of disbursements are to ensure that all disbursements are legal, proper, and correct and that all disbursements are accurately recorded, reported, and reconciled in a timely, efficient manner.\n\n• For non-state recipients, financial management policies and procedures must ensure that payment methods minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds from the United States Treasury or the pass-through entity and the disbursement by the non-Federal entity whether the payment is made by electronic funds transfer, or issuance or redemption of checks, warrants, or payment by other means.",

Requests for reimbursement of in-kind contributions are eligible as long as the value of each is documented and supported, represents a cost that would otherwise be eligible under the program, and is included in the net award costs in the award budget.\n\nRecipients may initiate drawdowns only when cash is needed for immediate reimbursement and must disburse the funds within three business days. Disbursement means that the recipient no longer controls the money (e.g., a check has been sent to a vendor). If the funds are not disbursed within three business days, FTA can charge interest beginning on day four. In most cases, recipients request funds on a reimbursement basis (after expenses have been incurred and paid). In some cases, (e.g., large bus procurements), recipients request funds prior to issuing a check. This procedure is acceptable as long as the funds are disbursed within three business days.\n\nPrior to each drawdown the recipient makes in excess of $50 million, the recipient must notify the FTA regional office. For drawdowns of more than $50 million but less than $500 million, the recipient must notify the FTA regional office two business days prior to initiating the drawdown.

          "applicability": "All recipients",
          "detailed_explanation": "Under federally-funded award programs, recipients may incur both direct and indirect costs. A federally approved CAP or ICRP is required to support the distribution of indirect costs to the award program. An organization must seek approval from its Federal cognizant agency as designated in the Uniform Guidance.\n\nA central service CAP is used by a state-wide, local government-wide, or Indian Tribe-wide agency to distribute executive and central level support functions to operating units which benefit from them. An ICRP may be for an entire organization or developed at the operating agency level to distribute administrative support and/or overhead costs of that agency to the programs (and the awards and contracts) that benefit from them.\n\nEffective December 26, 2014, non-Federal entities that have never received a negotiated indirect cost rate, except for those non-Federal entities described in Appendix VII to 2 CFR Part 200, \"States and Local Government and Indian Tribe Indirect Cost Proposals,\" paragraph D.1.b (receive below $35 million in direct Federal funding), may elect to charge a de minimis rate of 10 percent of modified total direct costs which may be used indefinitely. Effective November 13, 2020, the OMB expanded the ability for recipients that are non-Federal entities (except those described in Appendix VII to 2 CFR Part 200, \"States and Local Government and Indian Tribe Indirect Cost Proposals,\" paragraph D.1.b) and who's previously negotiated indirect cost rate has expired, to elect to charge a de minimis rate of 10 percent of modified total direct costs to the Federal award. FTA requests recipients complete a de minimis rate certification indicating they understand the requirements surrounding indirect cost rates and eligibility. Any currently approved agreements must expire before the recipient can apply the de minims rate.\n\nIn situations where the cognizant agency has determined that annual review of the plan or rate is not required, recipient organizations must continue to develop annual plans regarding indirect costs and maintain the proposal and related supporting documentation for audit. Unless required by the cognizant agency or FTA, these governmental units are not required to submit their proposals for review and approval. These organizations should maintain documentation to reflect this decision or policy to support the inclusion of indirect costs in the award.\n\nIn addition to the initial submission when it serves as the cognizant agency, FTA requires submission of the CAP under the following circumstances:\n• annually, if the recipient is a major local government (local government that receives more than $100 million in direct Federal awards)\n• the recipient has made a change in its organizational structure and its accounting system, that may significantly impact the CAP\n• the recipient changes the CAP; and\n• if requested by FTA\n\nFTA requires ICRPs to be submitted in the following circumstances:\n• The recipient is working on its first Federal assistance award or has not previously had an ICRP reviewed and accepted (note that such recipients may be eligible for the de minimis rate described above).\n• The recipient has made a change in its accounting system that significantly impacts the previously approved ICRP and its basis of application.\n• The recipient's proposed ICRP exceeds the rate(s) last approved by FTA by more than 20 percent. For example, if FTA approved a 20 percent rate in 2016, and the rate increased to 23 percent in 2017, and again to 25 percent in 2018, the 2018 rate would be required to be submitted to FTA for approval as it increased by more than 20 percent.\n• The recipient changes the ICRP methodology.\n• The recipient is either a local governmental unit that receives more than $35 million in direct Federal funding or a non-profit entity. In accordance with 2 CFR part 200, these entities must submit their plan annually to their cognizant agency.\n\nThe below table shows the respective cognizant agency for the entities listed.\n\nEntity Type: State & Local Airport, Transit Authority or Port Authority | Appendix to 2 CFR Part 200: Appendix V – (CAP), Appendix VII – (ICRP) | Cognizant Agency: Department of Transportation (DOT)\n\nEntity Type: State Government | Appendix to 2 CFR Part 200: Appendix V – (CAP), Appendix VII – (ICRP) | Cognizant Agency: Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)\n\nEntity Type: State, Local Housing, or Development Districts | Appendix to 2 CFR Part 200: Appendix V – (CAP), Appendix VII – (ICRP) | Cognizant Agency: Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)\n\nEntity Type: Local Government | Appendix to 2 CFR Part 200: Appendix V – (CAP), Appendix VII – (ICRP) | Cognizant Agency: Cognizant Agency of Indirect Costs: Determined by the agency providing the most direct federal funding or special arrangement between the concerned federal agencies.\n\nEntity Type: Tribe | Appendix to 2 CFR Part 200: Appendix V | Cognizant Agency: Department of the Interior\n\nEntity Type: University (Institute of Higher Education) | Appendix to 2 CFR Part 200: Appendix III | Cognizant Agency: HHS or Department of Defense Office of Naval Research (DOD Navy) based on amount of funding\n\nEntity Type: Non-Profit | Appendix to 2 CFR Part 200: Appendix IV | Cognizant Agency: Cognizant Agency for Indirect Costs: Determined by the agency providing the largest funding amount or special arrangement",

These reports are still due at the end of the postponed period. This means that if a report were due on April 30, 2021, FTA would now require the report to be submitted by July 31, 2021.

          "question": "Does the recipient have financial resources to provide the required local share for active awards and to maintain and operate FTA-funded assets?",
          "basic_requirement": "Recipients must have the financial capacity to carry out their proposed program of projects.",
          "applicability": "All recipients",
          "detailed_explanation": "Annually, the recipient certifies to FTA (as part of the annual certifications and assurances process) that it has the legal, financial, and technical capacity to carry out its proposed program of projects (POP), including safety and security aspects of the program.\n\nUpon request from FTA, the recipient agrees to provide a financial plan delineating the source of non-Federal share, the amounts applicable to the different sources, and the time frame for acquisition of the non-Federal share. Recipients must have multi-year financial plans (3–5 years) for operating and capital revenues and expenses to implement FTA awards. The financial plans should indicate adequate revenues to maintain and operate the existing system and to complete the annual program of projects (POP).\n\nAll local share used to match FTA awards must come from non-US DOT sources, except for Federal Lands Highway Program funds, including Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Tribal Transportation Program funds. No FTA program funds can be used as a source of local match for other FTA programs, even when the funds are contract revenue. Federal loan programs such as Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) or Railroad Rehabilitation & Improvement Financing (RRIF) count as Federal sources even though they are often repaid with local or state funds. Depending on the award program, FTA permits the use of the following as local share: cash (or in-kind contribution); non-farebox revenues from transit operations (e.g., advertising and concession revenues); amounts received under a service contract with a state, local, or private social service agency or organization; undistributed cash surpluses; replacement or depreciation cash funds; reserves available in cash or new capital; revenue bond proceeds (capital only); transportation development (toll) credits; program income generated from an earlier award; non-US DOT Federal funds if authorized by the originating program to be used for transportation; funds used to purchase vanpool vehicles by private providers of public vanpools (capital match only); and in-kind match for intercity bus service.\n\nA recipient's financial condition, future financial capacity, and ability to match FTA funds could be affected greatly if one or more of its sources of non-FTA funding are affected by pending legislation or \"sunset\" provisions in current legislation. The recipient's eligible and available non-Federal funds may be diverted from serving as match for an FTA award if there are other Federal awards which are at risk of lapsing. Similarly, when state and/or local sources of funding decrease, the recipient may be unable to meet the non-Federal match requirements for existing FTA awards. This may also result in service reductions and/or fare increases, redirection of funds to meet critical operating and maintenance needs, and/or staff reductions.\n\nIt should be noted that once matching funds are associated with a specific award, these funds cannot be applied to another award. Supporting documentation and recipient financial information may need to be reviewed to ensure there is no \"double dipping\" or overlapping of funds.",

The recipient is not required to monitor the financial management systems of subrecipients that do not receive Federal cash (e.g., subrecipients for which the recipients procures vehicles). Some recipients require applicants, especially first-time applicants, to describe their accounting systems or may perform a pre-award review of accounting systems. Other recipients require subrecipients to maintain separate accounting records for projects. In addition to financial and Single Audits, some recipients require subrecipients to have their auditors certify year-end financial statements or perform a program audit of their transit operations. The recipient is required to ensure that subrecipients can trace funds to a level of expenditures adequate to establish that the funds are used for eligible expenditures under the program. Common practices among pass-through entities include: reviewing Single Audits, requiring subrecipients to submit supporting documentation periodically, and requiring new and high-risk recipients to submit supporting documentation with every reimbursement request.",

Reports must be submitted for all active/executed awards, even if no activity occurred on those awards since the last report.\n\nRecipients are required to submit MPRs and FFRs based on the reporting frequency established by FTA. The reporting frequency depends on award program, award amount, recipient location, project type, and risk. FTA C. 5010.1E Award Management Requirements sets the reporting schedule and also permits FTA to adopt a risk-based approach to change the frequency of reporting. Since October 1, 2017, awards of $2 million or less awarded to recipients located in urbanized areas over 200,000 in population may be reported annually instead of quarterly unless FTA has identified a specific risk. FTA's risk-based approach reduced the frequency of reporting for some recipients.\n\nThe following table shows the current reporting frequency for MPRs and FFRs by program. FTA, at its discretion, can require more frequent reporting.\n\nBecause submitting late reports is a risk factor, patterns of late or unsubmitted reports may prompt FTA to take remedial action and increase reporting frequency requirements.\n\nMPR and FFR Reporting Frequency:\nRecipient/Program Project Reporting Frequency\nRecipients in large UZAs (>200,000) Awards >$2 million: Quarterly\nRecipients in large UZAs (>200,000) Awards <$2 million: Annually\nRecipients in small UZAs (<200,000) State-administered programs Section 5309-funded facility construction projects Section 5329: Quarterly\nRecipients in small UZAs (<200,000) All other projects: Annually\n\nIf FTA grants an extension to the report or if corrections can only be added outside the 30-day timeframe, the recipient should provide documentation relating to FTA's approval or instruction and note the change in their comments. Submissions outside the 30-day timeframe may only be submitted via a hard copy of the SF-425. These may be found under 'Application Documents' or 'Recipient Documents' in TrAMS.\n\nFLEXIBILITIES AND ADMINISTRATIVE RELIEF\nPer OMB Memorandum M-20-17 as part of the government's flexibilities in response to the Public Health Emergency, a recipient could delay submission of financial, performance, and other reports up to three (3) months beyond the normal due date. Recipients were permitted to draw down Federal funds without the timely submission of these reports. These reports must be submitted at the end of the postponed period. Therefore, due dates for quarterly MPRs and FFRs for the period ended March 31, 2020, would be extended from April 30, 2020, to July 30, 2020. Reports selected for review that were not submitted within 90 days of the original due date would be considered late.

Examples of these are: a signed contract for bus purchases for which delivery of vehicles has not yet occurred, a contract for construction services not rendered, open purchase orders, contract retention and unexpended portions of signed subrecipient agreements.\n\n• Unobligated balance is the amount of an award that has not been expended and is not covered by a binding commitment (unliquidated obligation) and is reported on an accrual basis.\n\n• Indirect expense is the amount of indirect costs charged to an award by the reporting organization and is reported on an accrual basis. The rate must be based on a previously approved cost allocation plan or indirect cost proposal. The recipient must report the total amount of indirect expenses incurred on a cumulative basis. The information should include the type of rate (whether it is provisional, predetermined, final or fixed), the rate approved by the cognizant agency, the total base amount from which the indirect cost rate is determined, the period covered by the approved rate, amount charged to the award, and the Federal share of the indirect expenses charged. If multiple rates are included in the report, additional documentation is uploaded as an attachment to the report.\n\n• The recipient must address any FTA comments either in a revised submission or in the subsequent report. Addressing inconsistencies may prevent returned reports, complies with FTA's instructions, and may eliminate confusion with FTA's Program Office and oversight reviews.\n\nFFRs must be accurate. Many recipients have program managers that prepare MPRs while financial personnel prepare FFRs. FTA has found frequent instances of data in FFRs not being reflected in MPRs and vice versa. For example, an MPR may indicate that the recipient has awarded a construction contract but the FFR does not report unliquidated obligations.",

The purpose of the FFR is to provide a current, complete, and accurate financial picture of the Award. This report is submitted electronically through TrAMS. The first 4 items (A-D) are prepared using cash accounting. The remaining report items (E-U) must be prepared on the accrual basis of accounting; that is, income is recorded when earned instead of when received, and expenses are recorded when incurred instead of when paid. These items, (E-U) of the FFR, may not be prepared on the cash basis of accounting, even though a recipient may keep its books on the cash basis during its accounting year.

          "applicability": "All recipients",
          "detailed_explanation": "FTA expects projects to be completed within the award's period of performance and potential delays updated in progress reports. However, noting delays or proposing date changes in the MPR is not sufficient to the change the period of performance. The period of performance may only be changed in TrAMS via an amendment or budget revision.\n\nFor Sections 5305, 5307, 5309, and 5339 projects, a good \"rule of thumb\" is to complete the project within the period of availability of funds. Once award funds are past the period of availability, the ability to amend the award to change the scope is limited, thus restricting the use of remaining funds to the original scope. For large, complicated construction or technology projects, completing the project and closing the award within the period of availability may not be feasible.\n\nSections 5310 and 5311 programs of projects should be implemented within two to three years of award approval. Recipients should take into account the status of current awards before awarding a subrecipient an award for a new project.\n\nFunds deobligated within the period of availability could be available for re-obligation to a new award.\n\nThe following table shows the period of availability of funds for selected programs.\n\nPeriod of Availability of Funds\nProgram MAP-21/FAST Act\n5305 Year of apportionment plus 3\n5307 Year of apportionment plus 5\n5309 discretionary Year of apportionment plus 4\n5310 Year of apportionment plus 2\n5311 Year of apportionment plus 2\n5329 Year of apportionment plus 2\n5337 Year of apportionment plus 3\n5339 Year of apportionment plus 3\n\nThe recipient must initiate award closeout with subrecipients no later than 90 or 120 days after the end of the period of performance or when the award's scope of work is completed. Recipients may not excessively prolong the life of the award merely for the purpose of expending all award funds, even if there is additional time remaining in the period of performance. Awards should be closed when the scope of work is completed; if funds remain these should be deobligated as part of the award closeout. Frequently, recipients allow small balances in completed projects to delay closeout. The recipient should have procedures for tracking project funds and reprogramming unused balances to other projects or closing out the award if funds cannot be utilized.\n\nA final FFR, MPR, reconciled budget, and, for Sections 5310 and 5311 awards, POP, are required at the time of closeout. It is not necessary to wait for the single audit or final indirect cost rates before closing an award.\n\nExamples of good award management practices include:\n1) As part of the annual award development process, identify available funds in existing awards before applying for new funds.\n2) Unless directed by the region, apply for remaining apportionments in the next year's award instead of amending awards to add apportionment balances. An award may contain multiple years' apportionments.\n3) Spend oldest funds first for on-going expenses such as program administration (financial purpose code (FPC) 6), operating assistance (FPC 4), ADA complementary paratransit (FPC 8), and preventive maintenance (FPC 0).\n4) Accumulate program administrative expenses in a generic account and then draw from the oldest award with available program administrative funds instead of charging the expenses directly to awards.\n5) Set project time limits (less than two years).\n6) Transfer small remaining balances to new line items.\n7) Move delayed projects to newer awards and active projects to older awards.\n8) Deobligate project balances and reapply for funds (if within period of availability and allowed by the FTA regional office).\n9) Regularly reconcile balances with those in TrAMS.\n10) Tie third party contracts to projects, then tie projects to award.\n11) When funding a project out of multiple awards, develop a drawdown plan.\n12) When funding a project out of multiple awards, charge retainage to the newest award (and report it as an unliquidated obligation) to enable the closing of older awards.\n\nFTA places a priority on closing out awards for which activity has ceased. FTA identifies awards that should be potentially closed out as those that are 100 percent disbursed or those that were obligated more than three years before and have not had a disbursement within the past 12 months.\n\nAwards that have been inactive for a substantial length of time should also be closed. Inactivity may be a result of delays in project implementation or lack of resources.\n\nIf an award has been delayed for a substantial period of time and the recipient does not have a reasonable explanation, FTA may determine that the funds should be deobligated and the award closed.\n\nOccasionally, a project may be delayed indefinitely because of factors beyond the recipient's control. If there is no realistic chance of a project going forward, FTA will deobligate the funds and make them available for other projects that are ready to proceed.\n\nFLEXIBILITIES AND ADMINISTRATIVE RELIEF\nRecipients with awards that expired (the period of performance ended) prior to June 16, 2020, may request an extension by submitting written notice to FTA regarding the reporting delay. This delay in submitting closeout reports may not exceed one year after the award expires. (OMB Memorandum M-20-17, Appendix A at 12, which authorized this flexibility, expired June 16, 2020 and was rescinded per OMB Memorandum M-20-26).",

Recipients must submit the state/program management plan(s) for the program(s) to the FTA regional office and to update it regularly to incorporate any changes in program management or new requirements. State/program management plans document the recipient's policies and procedures for the program(s). FTA gives the recipient the maximum discretion permitted by law in designing and managing the programs to meet the passengers' needs under those programs. The recipient develops program standards, criteria, procedures and policies. States that provide service directly and have no subrecipients under Sections 5310 or 5311 should develop a state management plan(s) that states that it provides the service directly and addresses how the program is managed and funding decisions are made. The state/program management plan is intended to facilitate program management and FTA oversight. The plan provides public information on the recipient's administration of the programs and may be used as a program guide for local applicants. The plan should contain sufficient detail to meet these objectives. While FTA does not prescribe a format for the plan, it does require that specific areas be covered for each program. The state/designated recipient may develop separate plans or a combined plan for the programs. Parallels in the programs make it desirable to consider all resources and plan for their use in a complementary way. Many of the policies and procedures implemented by the state/designated recipient may apply to all programs. FTA strongly encourages recipients to issue timely revisions to state/program management plans, particularly when information helpful to applicants, subrecipients, and third party contractors is involved. The recipient should seek public comment in making significant revisions to a plan. A significant revision is a change in recipient policy, such as a change in how projects and subrecipients are selected for funding. Updates to state/program management plans to reflect changes in FTA policy that do not trigger a change in recipient policy do not require public comment. Opportunity for comment should be given, at a minimum, to potential subrecipients, potential service providers, representatives of other funding sources, and any relevant state association or professional organization. Posting the revised plan(s) on the recipient's website seeking comments on revisions meets the requirement.",

          "detailed_explanation": "Many FTA requirements flow through the recipient to subrecipients. The recipient is responsible for ensuring that these entities are aware of and comply with the requirements. Before expending any FTA funds on projects, the recipient certifies to FTA that it and others operating on its behalf have met all statutory and program requirements. The recipient must have sufficient documentation to support the certifications to FTA.\n\nThe recipient must have an ongoing oversight system to ensure that subrecipients adhere to Federal requirements. While FTA does not prescribe specific monitoring activities for ensuring compliance, it does expect the recipient to look behind certifications and assurances, contracts, and agreements. FTA relies on each recipient to develop and implement effective systems for monitoring and ensuring compliance with requirements. A recipient's oversight of its subrecipient should reflect the size and complexity of its program. FTA expects recipients with a significant number of subrecipients to have formal oversight mechanisms.\n\nThe issue of monitoring compliance with Federal requirements is a continuing, critical theme throughout the Comprehensive Review. In each review area, the Comprehensive Review examines the specific mechanisms for monitoring compliance with the Federal requirements. The examination under Technical Capacity takes an overall look at the procedures in place for monitoring compliance with a range of Federal requirements. Appropriate mechanisms may include:\n• Applications\n• Monthly, quarterly or annual reports\n• Meetings\n• Site visits, assessments, and performance evaluations\n• Vehicle/facility inspections\n\nOnce an issue is discovered, FTA expects the recipient to follow up with the subrecipient to ensure that corrective action is taken. Efforts, including the follow-up on deficiencies, should be documented. It is not necessary for the recipient to perform all of its monitoring functions in-house.\n\nFTA provides Rural Transportation Assistance Program (RTAP) funds to assist states in providing technical assistance to transit operators in rural areas. In addition, state/program administrative expenses for the Sections 5310 and 5311 programs can be used for technical assistance. Technical assistance may be provided through orientations, informal conversations, formal correspondence, guides, onsite performance reviews, conferences, etc. Recipients sometimes provide detailed guidance for specific activities, such as vehicle procurement or maintenance. Many recipients sponsor annual conferences, frequently in conjunction with the state transit association, at which training in Federal requirements is provided.",

In that instance, the recipient would be found deficient in the review area but not Technical Capacity—Program Management.

Some state departments of transportation rely on district offices to oversee construction projects. A county or city may rely on the county or city engineer to manage a construction project. The transit system's own maintenance and operations directors typically oversee the inspection and acceptance of rolling stock, sometimes with consultant support. A recipient information technology (IT) department may oversee technology projects, sometimes with consultant support.\n\nWhen projects are implemented by an entity on behalf of a recipient, such as by a management contractor, the recipient is ultimately responsible for, and must ensure technical oversight of, the project. Monitoring mechanisms may include:\n• Contracting with a consultant to provide project management oversight\n• Reviewing requests for proposals and construction contracts\n• Reviewing plans and drawings\n• Conducting periodic site inspections\n• Requiring progress reports\n• Attending project review meetings\n• Withholding payment of a portion of the award until final inspection and acceptance of the project\n\nIf project delays are the result of inadequate actions by the recipient or of failure in performance by a contractor, there may be deficiencies in the recipient's technical oversight of projects. The recipient organizational structure and actions may contribute to continuing problems with project delays. Note that delays are not unusual in major construction and technology projects. For construction projects, land acquisition, zoning changes, environmental studies, weather, and other factors not under the complete control of the recipient may cause the delay.",

Force account work may consist of design, construction, overhaul, inspection, and construction management activities, if eligible for reimbursement as a capital expense under the Award. Force account work does not include Award or project administration activities that are otherwise direct project costs.

A justification to undertake force account work is required to use the recipient's own labor force greater than $1,000,000 on a project. One of four conditions may warrant the use of force account work. These are:\n\n(a) Cost savings.\n\nThe justification documentation must include the following information to be justified based on cost savings:\n\n1 A comparison of the present worth of the estimated cash drawdown for both the force account and private sector contract options;\n\n2 The recipient should use the current interest rate paid on one-year Treasury Bills as the discount rate;\n\n3 The recipient should include the cost of preparing documents, cost of administration, and inspection, cost of labor, materials and specialized equipment, cost of overhead, and profit for private contract;\n\n4 Unit prices for labor; materials and equipment; overhead; and profit, if applicable for private contract;\n\n5 Certification that costs presented are fair and reasonable; and\n\n6 The present value calculation based on the midpoint of construction, and if the time for completion of the work differs for force account and a private sector contract, include an estimate of the cost of not using the completed improvement in the present worth calculation. For example, if the work is to replace leased facilities, the cost of continuing the lease until the work is complete should be taken into account in the cost estimate for each option considered.\n\n(b) Exclusive expertise. The justification documentation must be based on exclusive expertise and must include documentation equivalent to a sole source justification stating the basis for a determination that no private-sector contractor has the expertise to perform the work.\n\n(c) Safety and efficiency of operations.\n\nThe justification documentation must include the following information to be justified based on safety and efficiency of operations:\n\n1 Safety considerations, which may be addressed by a statement of the transit operator's safety officer that performing the work with private-sector contractors would have an adverse effect on employee or public safety;\n\n2 Efficiency concerns, which may be addressed by a present worth calculation, including an estimate of the value of lost transit operation efficiency; and\n\n3 In emergency situations where the recipient uses its own workforce, the recipient may submit a waiver to the Emergency Relief docket.\n\n(d) Union Agreement.\n\nThe justification documentation must be based on exclusive expertise and must include documentation equivalent to a sole source justification stating the basis for a determination that no private-sector contractor has the expertise to perform the work.\n\n(5) Force Account Plans. Prior to incurring costs, a recipient must develop force account plans if it intends to use its own labor force in amounts greater than $1,000,000 on a project and retain the plan in its files. If the amount is $10,000,000 or greater, the force account plan must be submitted to FTA for approval, including the following information and must be approved by FTA prior to incurring costs:\n\n(a) A description of the scope of work;\n\n(b) A copy of the construction plans and specifications which includes a detailed estimate of costs and a detailed schedule and budget; and\n\n(c) A copy of the proposed Agreement when another public agency is involved.\n\nSpecial care must be taken to ensure that requirements of 2 CFR part 200 are followed, especially for charging expendable property to force account projects and making sure that allowable costs are assigned to the correct activity code."

This includes the administration and management of the Award in compliance with Federal regulations, the Grant or Cooperative Agreement, and applicable FTA circulars. A recipient is also responsible for Federal assistance that \"passes through\" to a subrecipient. In general, submission of the annual Certifications and Assurances stands in lieu of detailed FTA oversight before approval of an Award; however, the results of ongoing or routine FTA oversight activities also will be considered as applicable.\n\nAnnual, independent, organization-wide audits, 2 CFR part 200, subpart F, \"Audits\", audits of recipients, and other recurring and specialized reviews provide FTA an opportunity to verify the recipient's Certifications and Assurances (See Chapter V, \"Oversight,\" of this circular). The recipient's responsibilities include, but are not limited to, actions that:\n\n(1) Demonstrate the legal, financial, and technical capacity to carry out the program, including safety and security aspects of the program;\n\n(2) Provide administrative and management support of project implementation;\n\n(3) Provide, directly or by contract, adequate technical inspection and supervision by qualified professionals of all work in progress;\n\n(4) Ensure conformity to Grant Agreements and Cooperative Agreements, applicable statutes, codes, ordinances, and safety standards;\n\n(5) Maintain project work schedules agreed to by FTA and the recipient and monitor activities under the Award to assure schedules are met and other performance goals are achieved;\n\n(6) Keep expenditures within the latest approved Award Budget;\n\n(7) Ensure compliance with FTA and Federal requirements by agencies, consultants, contractors, and subcontractors working under approved third-party contracts or inter-agency agreements;\n\n(8) Request and withdraw federal assistance for eligible activities only in amounts and at times needed to make payments that are due and payable within three (3) business days and retain receipts to substantiate withdrawals;\n\n(9) Account for project property and maintain property inventory records that contain all the elements required;\n\n(10) Demonstrate and retain satisfactory continuing control over the use of project property;\n\n(11) Demonstrate procedures for asset management and adequate maintenance of equipment and facilities;\n\n(12) Ensure that an annual independent organization-wide audit is conducted in accordance with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, \"Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards,\" 2 CFR part 200, which is incorporated by reference in 2 CFR part 1201, Prepare Force Account Plans and Cost Allocation Plans (CAPs) or Indirect Cost Proposals and submit and obtain approval if applicable, before incurring costs;\n\n(13) Prepare required reports (See Chapter III, Section 3, \"Reporting Requirements\") for submission to FTA;\n\n(14) Update and retain FTA required reports and records for availability during audits or oversight reviews;\n\n(15) Ensure effective control and accountability are maintained for all Grants, Cooperative Agreements, and subagreements, cash, real and personal property, and other assets. Recipients and subrecipients must ensure that resources are properly used and safeguarded, and used solely for authorized purposes;\n\n(16) Obtain all necessary prior approvals and/or waivers before incurring costs or taking any requested actions; and\n\n(17) Manage roles and responsibilities of the organization's users in TrAMS."

Real property includes land, affixed land improvements, structures, and appurtenances. Examples of incidental use include the leasing of space in a station for a newspaper stand or coffee shop and the lease of air rights over transit facilities. (Note that licenses and leases of air rights are treated as incidental uses, not disposition of excess property.) Such use must be compatible with the approved purposes of the project, must not interfere with intended public transportation uses of project assets, must not in any way interfere with the recipient's continuing control over the use of the property, and must not compromise safety. FTA encourages recipients to make incidental use of FTA-funded real property when it can raise additional revenues for the transit system or, at a reasonable cost, enhance system ridership. While FTA is particularly interested in encouraging incidental use as a means of supplementing transit revenue, non-profit uses are permitted, under certain circumstances. The recipient should consult with FTA before continuing incidental use.\n\nThough not required, proceeds should be based on competitive market rents and rates of return based on the appraised fair market value. Income received from the authorized incidental or joint development uses may be retained by the recipient (without returning the Federal share) if the income is used for eligible transit capital and operating expenses. This income cannot be used as part of the local share of the award from which it was derived. However, it may be used as part of the local share of another FTA award.",

              "text": "(6) Non-Transit Uses of FTA Assisted Real Property. FTA's policy is to permit recipients maximum flexibility in determining the best and most cost-effective use of Federally-assisted property. To this end, FTA encourages non-transit uses of real property that can raise additional revenues for the transit system or, at a reasonable cost, enhance system ridership. These non-transit uses are by one of three means: incidental use, joint development, or shared use.\n\n(a) Incidental Use. Incidental uses must be compatible with the approved purposes of the Award and may not interfere with either the intended uses of the property or the recipient's ability to maintain satisfactory continuing control. The recipient should consult with FTA before continuing with incidental use. An incidental use may not affect a property's transit capacity or use. Alterations to accommodate an incidental use should have no negative impact on the transit service or activity. FTA continues to monitor the incidental use after the Award is closed and the recipient is required to keep an inventory of the use. FTA reviews the inventory during the triennial review process.\n\n1 Examples of incidental use include:\na. Temporary use of transit property as a staging area for nearby construction;\nb. Allowing nearby theaters and restaurants to use transit parking spaces during the transit system's off-hours;\nc. Leasing of space in a station for a newspaper stand or coffee shop when the additional use does not interfere with the original purpose authorized in the Award; and\nd. The lease of air rights over transit facilities or utilities associated with transit facilities (such as spare capacity in general utilities and fiber optics communications utilities) that do not impact the structural configuration of the transit facility.\n\n2 Revocation. An incidental use agreement should permit revocation by the recipient.\n\n3 Limits. The recipient agrees that any incidental use of federally assisted property will not exceed that permitted under applicable Federal requirements and Federal guidance. The recipient may permit non-transit public entities and private entities to have incidental use of its federally assisted facilities and equipment, including alternative fueling facilities and associated equipment, subject to the following considerations:\n\na. Needed Property. This policy applies only to property that continues to be needed and used for an FTA Award. It is FTA's intention to assist only in the purchase of property that is needed for an FTA Award.\n\nb. Purpose & Activity. The use must not compromise the safe conduct of the intended purpose and activity of the initial public transit activity under the Award.\n\nc. Continuing Control. The use must not in any way interfere with the recipient's continuing control over the use of the property or the recipient's continued ability to carry out the Award.\n\nd. No-Income Use. While FTA is particularly interested in encouraging incidental use as a means of supplementing transit revenues, no-income uses are also permitted under certain circumstances: For example, a no-income use could include a private, for-profit transit operator offered queue space, or loading space, at an intermodal facility for the purpose of generating rides, providing a consolidated transit option for the public, and a seamless transit transfer opportunity at no cost. The no-income use shows that the value of having the private operator: 1) benefits transit, as a whole; 2) expands upon the local transportation alternatives; and 3) allows the public to transfer seamlessly.\n\ne. Income. Proceeds from incidental use including licensing and leasing of air rights or leasing of other real property interest should be based on competitive market rents and rates of return based on the appraised fair market value. Income received from the authorized incidental uses including the use of air rights may be retained by the recipients (without returning the Federal share) if the income is used for eligible transit capital, or operating expenses. This income cannot be used as part of the non-Federal share of the Award from which it was derived. However, it may be used as part of the non-Federal share of another FTA Award."

Competitively market and sell the property and pay FTA the greater of its share of the fair market value of the property or the straight line depreciated value of the improvements plus land value. FTA's share of the fair market value is the percentage of FTA participation in the original Award multiplied by the best obtainable price, minus reasonable sales costs. If the property has never been used for the appropriate purposes of the Award, the recipient shall sell the property and pay FTA the greater of FTA's share of the fair market value or the entire amount of Federal assistance spent on that property.\n2 Offset. Sell the property and apply the net proceeds from the sale to the cost of replacement property under the same program. Return any excess proceeds to FTA in accordance with 2 CFR § 200.311.\n3 Sell and Use Proceeds for Other Capital Projects Under an Award. Sell the property and use the proceeds to reduce the gross cost of another FTA eligible capital transit project under an Award. See 49 U.S.C. § 5334(h)(4). The recipient is expected to record the receipt of the proceeds in the recipient's accounting system, showing that the funds are restricted for use in a subsequent capital project, and reduce the amount of those restricted funds as those proceeds are applied to one or more FTA approved capital projects under Awards. FTA must approve the application of the proceeds to a subsequent capital Award, which should clearly show that the gross cost of the Award has been reduced with proceeds from the earlier transaction. Examples of future FTA eligible capital transit projects include: the acquisition of buses, facilities, and equipment.\n4 Sell and Keep Proceeds in an Open Award. If the Award is still open, the recipient may sell the excess property and apply the proceeds to the original cost of the total real property purchased for that Award. This may reduce the Federal share of the Award.\n5 Transfer to Public Agency for Non-Transit Use. Follow procedures for publication in the Federal Register to transfer property (land or equipment) to a public agency with no repayment to FTA. This is a competitive process, and there is no guarantee that a particular public agency will be awarded the excess property. See 49 U.S.C. § 5334(h)(1) – (h)(3).\n6 Transfer to Another Award. Transfer the property to another FTA eligible Award. The Federal interest continues.\n7 Retain Title with Buyout. Compensate FTA by computing the percentage of FTA participation in the original cost. Multiply the current fair market value of the property by this percentage. The recipient must document the basis for value determination; typically, this documentation is an appraisal or market survey. Alternatively, the recipient may pay FTA the straight-line depreciated value of improvements plus land value, if this is greater than FTA's share of the fair market value.\n8 Sales Procedure. Sales procedures shall be followed that provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return or at least payment of appraised fair market value."

Specifically, Federal agencies may not provide any financial assistance for the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, repair, or improvement of a building unless the recipient has first acquired flood insurance under FDPA to cover the buildings constructed or repaired with Federal funds. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has defined \"building\" in its regulations implementing the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as \"a building with two or more outside rigid walls and a fully secured roof that is affixed to a permanent site.\" In addition, where structures are both above and below ground, the flood insurance requirement applies where at least 51 percent of the cash value of the structure, less land value, is above ground.\n\nSection 401a of the FDPA of 1973 states flood insurance shall not be required on any state-owned property that is covered under a state policy of self-insurance satisfactory to the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The following states have submitted applications and adequate supporting documentation and have been determined by the Federal Insurance Administrator to be exempt from the requirement of flood insurance on state-owned structures and their contents because they have in effect adequate state plans of self-insurance: Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Vermont.\n\nSelf-insurance may not be used to satisfy flood insurance requirements for non-state entities or states that have not been exempted from the requirements by the Federal Insurance Administrator.",

FTA is also entitled to its share of the remaining Federal interest of equipment with a fair market value over $5,000. The Federal interest is the greater of the FTA share of the straight-line depreciated value (based on years or miles for rolling stock) or the sale price.\n\nEquipment with a unit market value of $5,000 or less that has reached the end of its useful life requires no FTA reimbursement. Equipment that has reached the end of its useful life and for which the unit market value exceeds $5,000 requires reimbursement to FTA of the proportionate share of the fair market value or the net proceeds of the sale and may have specific requirements based on the timing of the sale as set forth in 49 USC § 5334(h)(4)(B). Disposition of equipment before the end of its useful life requires prior FTA approval. A rolling stock status report, an example of which is provided in FTA C. 5010.1E Appendix E, must accompany the request. Service life for rolling stock and facilities is defined at the end of this section. The useful life in years refers to total time in service, not time spent otherwise unavailable for regular transit use. The recipient should have a mechanism to adjust the service life of any FTA-funded vehicle for significant time (i.e., six months) or mileage not spent in regular transit use. The recipient may elect to use the trade-in value or the sales proceeds from a bus or rail vehicle to acquire a replacement vehicle of like kind, subject to FTA approval.\n\nThe IIJA changed the provisions for transit asset disposition 49 USC § 5334(h)(4)(B). For rolling stock, equipment and aggregate supplies that have met their minimum useful life and were (1) purchased with federal assistance, (2) with a fair market value of more than $5,000, and (3) sold after November 15, 2021, the recipient may retain a portion of the funds, $5,000 plus the percentage of its local share in the original award. Any remaining federal share must be returned to FTA. The federal share of the sales proceeds cannot be retained for public transportation use. The remaining federal share must be returned to FTA using pay.gov.\n\nNOTE: Section 49 USC § 5334(h) does not apply to insurance proceeds or state and non-state recipients addressed these transactions prior to the provisions taking effect. Therefore, state recipients continue to follow their own equipment management procedures for insurance proceeds and non-state recipients continue to adhere to the requirement of FTA Circular 5010.\n\nThe net income from asset sales, uses, or leases (including lease renewals) under 49 USC § 5334(h) shall be used by the recipient to reduce the gross project cost of other FTA funded capital projects. If the recipient or a subrecipient receives insurance proceeds when project property has been lost or damaged by fire, casualty, or natural disaster, the recipient must:\n• Apply those proceeds to the cost of replacing the damaged or destroyed project property taken out of service, or\n• Return to FTA an amount equal to the remaining Federal interest in the lost, damaged, or destroyed project property.\n\nThe Federal interest is not dependent on the extent of insurance coverage or on the insurance adjustment received.",

FTA retains financial interest in equipment with a unit value exceeding $5000, and supplies with an aggregate value exceeding $5000, even if useful life has been met. State recipients must dispose of federally assisted property acquired under an Award by the state in accordance with state laws and procedures. Subrecipients of states will follow such policies and procedures allowed by the state with respect to disposition of equipment acquired under an FTA Award. (3)Disposition or Inappropriate Use Before the End of the Asset's Useful Life: Any disposition of Federally assisted property before the end of its useful life requires prior FTA approval. FTA is entitled to its share of the remaining Federal interest. (c) Insurance Proceeds. If the grantee receives insurance proceeds when project property has been lost or damaged by fire, casualty, or natural disaster, the grantee agrees to: 1 Apply those proceeds to the cost of replacing the Federally assisted property that is damaged or destroyed or taken out of service, or 2 Return to FTA an amount equal to the remaining Federal interest in the Federally assisted property that is lost, damaged, or destroyed project property. The Federal interest does not depend on the extent of insurance coverage or on the insurance adjustment received. (d)Like-Kind Exchange Policy. With prior FTA approval, equipment may be disposed of before the end of its minimum useful life. In lieu of returning the Federal share to FTA, a recipient may elect to transfer the remaining Federal interest to replacement equipment of like kind. 'Like-Kind' is defined as a bus for a bus with a similar useful life and a rail vehicle for a rail vehicle. Under the Like-Kind Exchange Policy, proceeds from the Federal share of the vehicle disposition are not returned to FTA; instead, all proceeds are reinvested in acquisition of the like-kind replacement vehicle. If the disposition proceeds are less than the amount of the Federal interest in the vehicle at the time it is being replaced, the recipient is responsible for providing the difference, along with the recipient's share of the cost of the replacement vehicle. If sales proceeds are greater than the amount of the Federal interest in the vehicle traded in or sold, the investment of all proceeds in acquisition of the like-kind replacement vehicle results in a reduction of the gross project cost. (4) Disposition or Use of Assets for Other Than Purposes of the Award after the End of Their Useful Life. (a) Retain and Use Elsewhere. After the minimum useful life of federally assisted property is reached or the property is no longer needed for the original Award, it may be used by the recipient for other transit projects or programs. FTA prior approval of this alternative is not required. FTA retains its interest in the federally assisted property if its fair market value exceeds $5,000. (b) Disposition of Property with a Fair Market Value of More Than $5,000. After the useful life of federally assisted property is reached, or the property is no longer needed for the original Award, rolling stock and equipment with a current market value exceeding $5,000 per unit, or unused supplies with a total aggregate fair market value of more than $5,000, may be retained or sold. FTA is entitled to an amount calculated by multiplying the current market value, or proceeds from sale, by FTA's percentage of participation in the cost of the original purchase. Rolling stock and equipment that is sold may have the amount due FTA reduced by an amount of $500 or ten percent of the proceeds, whichever is less, for its selling and handling expenses. (c) Sell and Use the Proceeds for Other Capital Awards, 49 U.S.C. § 5334(h)(4). After the useful life is met, or the property is no longer needed, and with prior FTA approval, the recipient may sell its federally assisted property for which there is no longer any public transportation purposes and use the proceeds to reduce the gross project cost of other future FTA eligible capital transit Awards. The recipient is expected to record the receipt of the proceeds in the recipient's accounting system, showing that the funds are restricted for use in a future capital Award, and reduce the liability as the proceeds are applied to one or more FTA approved capital Awards. If new applications are not immediately anticipated, the recipient must inform the appropriate FTA contact of the disposition within a reasonable amount of time. Otherwise, the subsequent capital application should contain information showing FTA that the gross project cost has been reduced with proceeds from the earlier transaction. The proceeds cannot retroactively be applied to an existing Award or project unless the Award is still open. (d) Disposition of Property with a Fair Market Value of $5,000 or Less Value. After the useful life of its federally assisted property is reached, rolling stock and equipment with a unit market value of $5,000 or less, or supplies with a total aggregate market value of $5,000 or less, may be retained, sold, or otherwise disposed of with no obligation to reimburse FTA.

If no application award was submitted/received in TrAMS since the recipient exceeded the 20 percent spare ratio requirement, ask the recipient to explain the reasons for the excess rolling stock, such as overall age of the fleet, different types of technologies, unique weather operating conditions, etc. Determine if buses in the fleet exceed the useful life benchmark. Determine whether and how often the recipient is able to meet pullout. For recipients with contingency fleets review the contingency fleet plan to determine if the plan addresses the required elements. Review the recipient's equipment records to confirm the vehicles listed in the contingency fleet have met their useful lives. Ensure that the plan addresses the current contingency fleet.",

              "text": "Spare ratios will be taken into account in the review of Award proposed to replace, rebuild, or acquire additional vehicles. Spare ratio is defined as the total number of spare vehicles available for fixed-route service (regardless of type) divided by the total number of fixed-route vehicles required for annual maximum service (regardless of type). Spare ratio is usually expressed as a percentage, e.g., 100 vehicles required for maximum fixed-route service and 20 spare vehicles is a 20 percent spare ratio. Spare ratios are calculated for the transit system as a whole, not by vehicle type. For purposes of the spare ratio calculation, 'vehicles operated in maximum fixed-route service' is defined as the total number of revenue vehicles operated to meet the annual maximum service requirement. This is the revenue vehicle count during the peak week, day, and hours maximum service is provided. It excludes atypical days and special events. (1) Bus Fleet. The basis for determining a reasonable spare bus ratio takes local circumstances into account. The number of spare buses in the active fleet for recipients operating 50 or more fixed-route revenue vehicles should not exceed 20 percent of the number of vehicles operated in maximum fixed-route service. FTA does not set a specific spare ratio for smaller operators, but expects the number of spare buses to be reasonable, taking into account the number of vehicles and variety of vehicle types and sizes. Buses delivered for future expansion and buses that have been replaced, but are in the process of being disposed of, are not included in the calculation of spare ratio. For each application identified to acquire vehicles, the applicant should address the subjects of current spare ratio, the spare ratio anticipated at the time the new vehicles are introduced into service, disposition of vehicles to be replaced including information on age and mileage, and the applicant's conformance with FTA's spare ratio guideline. An applicant is required to notify FTA if the spare ratio computation on which the application is based is significantly altered before the Award is made… (3) Spare Ratio Deviation. Recipients of buses recently procured may temporarily exceed their spare ratio thresholds. In those cases, recipients may seek a short-term deviation from the spare ratio requirements for small deviations. Recipients should prepare a brief justification explaining the reason for the deviation, a date by which the fleet spare ratio will come into compliance with the general requirements, and the recipient's plans to come into compliance. The deviation will generally be granted for no more than two (2) years and must be approved by the regional administrator either in writing or by approval of the Award. Recipients must promptly inform the Regional Office of any significant changes related to spare ratios, including plans for disposition or acquisition of vehicles and changes in vehicle needs. (4) Contingency Fleet. FTA recognizes two types of vehicles —active and contingency. Revenue rolling stock stockpiled in a contingency fleet in preparation for emergencies must have met their minimum useful life requirements and must be properly stored, maintained, and documented in a contingency plan. FTA will also permit agencies to include vehicles that have met their minimum useful life in their contingency fleet if an agency is introducing zero emission vehicles into its fleet. These vehicles are not included in the calculation of spare ratio. Contingency plans are subject to review during triennial reviews and other FTA oversight reviews. Any rolling stock not supported by a contingency plan will be considered part of the active fleet. Contingency fleet means inactive rolling stock reserved or retained for emergencies or other unforeseen and justified activities. These activities could include the evacuation of people during an emergency, use as crowd control or traffic barriers, loaners to other transit agencies during a justified need, temporary replacements for buses in the active fleet during major active fleet overhauls or bus maintenance activities and other activities that take a portion of the active fleet temporarily out of service. The recipient should keep a record of information that demonstrates the need for the contingency fleet activation, the justification for activation and the period of time of activation. The contingency fleet plan should demonstrate that the bus has met its useful life by identifying the year the bus was placed in service, the year, and mileage when removed from service and the useful life of the bus in years and miles. The plan should identify where the buses will be stored, how they will be protected and list the maintenance activities performed on the bus to ensure they maintain their contingency bus fleet status."

Nevertheless, rail operators should be aware that the recipient's rail vehicle spare ratio and the rationale underlying that spare ratio will be examined during the triennial review whenever FTA assistance is used to purchase or rebuild rail vehicles. The following guidance should be used to support an operator's proposed rail vehicle spare ratio when the spare ratio is under review by FTA: (a)An operator of a rail system should have in its file available upon request by FTA a rail fleet management plan that addresses operating policies (level of service requirements; train failure definitions, and actions); peak vehicle requirements (service period and make-up, e.g., standby trains); maintenance and overhaul programs (scheduled, unscheduled, and overhaul); system and service expansions; railcar procurements and related schedules; and spare ratio justifications. (b)The spare ratio justification should consider the average number of railcars out of service for scheduled maintenance, the unscheduled maintenance and overhaul program, the allowance for ridership variation (historical data), ridership changes that affect railcar needs caused by expansion of the system or services, the contingency for destroyed railcars, and railcar procurements for replacements and system expansions. (c)Railcars delivered for future expansion and railcars that have been replaced, but are in the process of being disposed of, should not be included in the calculation of spare ratio. (d)Peak Vehicle Requirements include 'standby' trains that are scheduled, ready for service, and have a designated crew. (e) Factors that may influence spare ratios are the type of equipment (locomotive hauled trains; married pair units or single railcars, equipment design, reliability, and age), environmental conditions (weather, above ground or underground operation, loading and track layout), operational policies (standby trains, load factors, headways), maintenance policies (conditions for removing railcars from service, maintenance during nights and weekends, and labor agreement conditions), and maintenance facilities and staff capabilities."

Proper maintenance of assets is key to protecting the FTA investment and prolonging the useful life of assets.\n\nAll recipients with direct control over FTA-funded assets must:\n• Have a written maintenance plan(s) for FTA-funded assets; and\n• The plan(s) must describe a system of periodic inspections and preventive maintenance to be performed at certain defined intervals. Note: It is sufficient if the recipient's system is maintained digitally in its maintenance management information system, instead of in the physical maintenance plan(s).\n\nFor Section 5307-funded assets, the written maintenance plans should identify the goals and objectives of a maintenance program, which may include, for example, vehicle life, frequency of road calls, and maintenance costs compared to total operating costs and establish how the recipient will meet such goals and objectives. Plans should be updated with the purchase of new rolling stock to account for new technology and/or new manufacturer's recommended maintenance intervals and programs, and incorporate actions to maintain each vehicle type and model on a specific cycle. These actions will help ensure proper care and maximize vehicle longevity.\n\nFor vehicles under warranty, the recipient typically must perform a series of preventive maintenance actions if the warranty is to remain valid. If the recipient either does not perform these required maintenance routines, or performs them at greater intervals than the manufacturer's maximum intervals, the recipient runs the risk of invalidating vehicle warranty provisions. Some operators have relied on oil analysis to extend the interval between oil changes beyond the engine manufacturer's recommended interval. This is acceptable provided the recipient has a letter from the manufacturer of the vehicles' engines stating that this practice will not void the engine warranty.\n\nFTA requires that rail operators purchasing vehicles with FTA funds have a rail fleet management plan that has been reviewed by FTA. FTA has extended this requirement to \"new start\" bus operations. These plans make brief mention of maintenance procedures. Normally, rail operators rely on more extensive written maintenance policies and procedures than those included in its rail fleet management plan.\n\nThe maintenance plan(s) should also address specific mission critical and safety items, which include, but are not limited to:\n• Buildings • Plumbing systems\n• Elevators • Overhead doors\n• Escalators • Vehicle maintenance lifts\n• Passenger stations/shelters • Vehicle washers and wash water recycling systems\n• Parking lots • Heating and/or air conditioning units\n• Right-of-way (guideway, track, ballast, etc.) • Power substations, etc.\n• Electric distribution and control equipment • Security equipment\n\nIn the case of rail systems, FTA's investment often involves the construction of passenger stations, rights-of-way, signals, and other related facilities and equipment. While Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) regulates commuter rail systems and has detailed maintenance requirements for rolling stock, signals, and right-of-way that it enforces with a frequent inspection program, proper maintenance is needed by recipients for those components of the rail system not subject to FRA maintenance requirements, such as passenger stations, maintenance facilities, buildings, and equipment.",

          "instructions_for_reviewer": "For vehicles/vessels: Review the vehicle/vessel maintenance plan(s)/program(s) for the interval (miles or operated hours) between preventive maintenance inspections. Check preventive maintenance inspection intervals by reviewing management reports used by the recipient for monitoring preventive maintenance inspections and by reviewing records for a selected sample of FTA-funded vehicles in accordance with the sampling procedures below. Determine the maintenance interval for each mode operated. In some cases, intervals also may vary by sub-fleet. Examine preventive maintenance records (manual or electronic) while on-site to determine whether the recipient is performing inspections according to its maintenance plan.\n\nMost recipients schedule preventive maintenance inspections based on relative miles (e.g., 6,000 miles since the last inspection) or hours of service. Others schedule based on absolute miles or hours. Recipients may choose either method, or a combination of the two, if warranted (e.g., recipients whose fleets operate very few miles annually, or recipients that operate seasonal fleets).\n\nFTA allows recipients discretion in determining the appropriate intervals for preventive maintenance inspections to accommodate such things as specific manufacturer recommendations, vehicle/vessel age, unique site and operating conditions, etc. FTA expects recipients to follow their program for preventive maintenance but understands that circumstances may prevent inspections being completed exactly at the interval specified. To account for this, FTA allows a 10 percent deviation from the scheduled interval as being considered on time. Review the sample preventive maintenance history to determine if fewer than 80 percent of the inspections for any mode or operation occurred on time.\n\nFor each vehicle/vessel chosen, examine the preventive maintenance history for the preceding 12 months. Using the table above, note the date when each inspection was accomplished and record the vehicle mileage (or hours) at the time of each inspection.\n\nFor commuter rail locomotives and cars, in lieu of selecting a sample of preventive maintenance records, examine Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) inspection records to determine if FRA compliance letters indicate that the recipient does not meet the FRA scheduled maintenance intervals. If the recipient is unable to provide a compliance letter from FRA, sample the commuter rail fleet.\n\nIn addition, if during the facility tour an FTA-funded asset is observed that does not appear to be sufficiently maintained, request and review the preventive maintenance records for that item.\n\nFor facilities and equipment: Review the recipient's preventive maintenance inspection intervals by reviewing management reports used by the recipient for monitoring preventive maintenance inspections and by reviewing a sample of facility and equipment maintenance records in accordance with the sampling procedures below. For each item in the sample, examine the facility/equipment maintenance history for the preceding 12 months. Using the table above, note the date when each inspection was accomplished and record the interval from the previous inspection. Compare the interval with the recipient's definition of an \"on-time\" inspection to determine if the inspection was in accordance with the recipient's facility and equipment maintenance plan.\n\nMaintenance record selection procedures for vehicles:\nFor modes that do not include federally-funded vehicles, limit the examination to preventive maintenance of ADA accessibility features.\n\nFor all modes with FTA-funded vehicles, select a minimum of three vehicles up to a total of one percent of the FTA-funded fleet for each mode (whichever is greater). Modes are classified per National Transit Database definitions as follows:\n\nNon-Rail Modes: Motorbus – DO, Motorbus – PT, Demand Response – DO, Demand Response – PT, Trolleybus, Ferryboat, Vanpool, Jitney, Público\n\nRail Modes: Light Rail, Heavy Rail, Commuter Rail, Cable Car, Automated Guideway, Monorail, Inclined Plane, Aerial Tramway\n\nFor directly operated service (DO), obtain a sample across all garages/yards. For recipients that use a combination of directly operated (DO) and purchased transportation (PT), treat the DO and PT portions as separate modes. For larger recipients that use multiple contractors, treat each contractor visited as a mode. For recipients with subrecipients, treat the subrecipients visited as a mode. Consult with the regional office in selecting the garages, contractors, and subrecipients to visit. To the extent practical, distribute the sample of vehicles selected by age and subfleet in each mode.\n\nMaintenance record selection procedures for facilities and equipment:\nIf the recipient operates a commuter railroad, ask the recipient to identify those FTA-funded items that are not regulated by the FRA. Select a sample of three facility and three equipment items to examine for each mode. Sample critical items, such as fire suppression systems, hoists, lifts, emergency generators, power substations, rail right of way, and catenary, and ADA accessibility features, such as elevators, escalators, and lifts. In addition, if during the facility tour an FTA-funded asset is observed that does not appear to be sufficiently maintained, request and review the preventive maintenance records for that item.",

          "basic_requirement": "All recipients must have written procurement policies and procedures.",
          "applicability": "Non-state recipients",
          "detailed_explanation": "All recipients must have written procurement policies and procedures.\n\nPolicies and procedures must explain how the recipient will ensure compliance with the standards and requirements identified in 2 CFR 200.318 (General Procurement Standards) through 200.327 (Contract Provisions) including:\n\nGeneral procurement standards\n• Contract oversight: Recipients must maintain oversight to ensure that contractors perform in accordance with the terms, conditions, and specifications of their contracts or purchase orders.\n• Standards of conduct: Recipients must maintain written standards of conduct covering conflicts of interest and governing the performance of its employees engaged in the selection, award and administration of contracts. No employee, officer, or agent must participate in the selection, award, or administration of a contract supported by a Federal award if he or she has a real or apparent conflict of interest. An employee, officer, agent, and board member of the recipient may neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors. The standards of conduct must provide for disciplinary actions to be applied for violations of such standards by officers, employees, or agents of the non-Federal entity. If the recipient has a parent, affiliate, or subsidiary organization that is not a state, local government, or Indian tribe, the recipient must also maintain written standards of conduct covering organizational conflicts of interest. Organizational conflicts of interest means that because of relationships with a parent company, affiliate, or subsidiary organization, the recipient is unable or appears to be unable to be impartial in conducting a procurement action involving a related organization.\n• Unnecessary or duplicative items: The recipient's procedures must avoid the acquisition of unnecessary or duplicative items.\n• Award to responsible contractors: The recipient must award contracts only to responsible contractors possessing the ability to perform successfully under the terms and conditions of a proposed procurement.\n• Procurement history: The recipient must maintain records sufficient to detail the history of the procurement. These records will include, but are not necessarily limited to the following: rationale for the method of procurement, selection of contract type, contractor selection or rejection, and the basis for the contract price.\n• Time and Material contracts: The recipient may use time and material type contracts only after a determination that no other contract is suitable and if the contract includes a ceiling price that the contractor exceeds at its own risk. Since this contract type generates an open-ended contract price, a time-and-materials contract provides no positive profit incentive to the contractor for cost control or labor efficiency. Therefore, each contract must set a ceiling price that the contractor exceeds at its own risk. Further, the recipient awarding such a contract must assert a high degree of oversight in order to obtain reasonable assurance that the contractor is using efficient methods and effective cost controls.\n• Contract dispute resolution: The recipient alone must be responsible, in accordance with good administrative practice and sound business judgment, for the settlement of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements. These issues include, but are not limited to, source evaluation, protests, disputes, and claims.\n\nCompetition\n• Full and open competition: All procurement transactions must be conducted in a manner that provides full and open competition, unless there are specific circumstances in which noncompetitive procurement can be used. In order to ensure objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive advantage, contractors that develop or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, or invitations for bids or requests for proposals must be excluded from competing for such procurements. Some of the situations considered to be restrictive of competition include but are not limited to:\n  o Placing unreasonable requirements on firms in order for them to qualify to do business;\n  o Requiring unnecessary experience and excessive bonding;\n  o Noncompetitive pricing practices between firms or between affiliated companies;\n  o Noncompetitive contracts to consultants that are on retainer contracts;\n  o Organizational conflicts of interest;\n  o Specifying only a \"brand name\" product instead of allowing \"an equal\" product to be offered and describing the performance or other relevant requirements of the procurement; and\n  o Any arbitrary action in the procurement process.\n• Geographic Preference: The recipient must conduct procurements in a manner that prohibits the use of statutorily or administratively imposed state, local, or tribal geographical preferences in the evaluation of bids or proposals, except in those cases where applicable Federal statutes expressly mandate or encourage geographic preference. A recipient or subrecipient may implement a local or other geographical or economic hiring preference relating to the use of labor for construction of a project funded by the grant, including prehire agreements, subject to any applicable State and local laws, policies, and procedures Nothing in 2 CFR Part 200 preempts state licensing laws. When contracting for A&E services, geographic location may be a selection criterion provided its application leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project, to compete for the contract.\n• Procedures for procurement transactions: The recipient must have written procedures for procurement transactions. These procedures must ensure that all solicitations:\n  o Incorporate a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product, or service to be procured. Such description must not, in competitive procurements, contain features which unduly restrict competition. The description may include a statement of the qualitative nature of the material, product or service to be procured and, when necessary, must set forth those minimum essential characteristics and standards to which it must conform if it is to satisfy its intended use. Detailed product specifications should be avoided if at all possible. When it is impractical or uneconomical to make a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements, a \"brand name or equivalent\" description may be used as a means to define the performance or other salient requirements of procurement. The specific features of the named brand which must be met by offerors must be clearly stated; and\n  o Identify all requirements which the offerors must fulfill and all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.\n• Prequalification: The recipient must ensure that all prequalified lists of persons, firms, or products which are used in acquiring goods and services are current and include enough qualified sources to ensure maximum full and open competition. Also, the non-Federal entity must not preclude potential bidders from qualifying during the solicitation period.\n\nMethods of procurement\n• Allowed methods of procurement: Recipients must use one of the following methods of procurement: (1) micro-purchases; (2) simplified acquisition procedures; (3) sealed bid; (4) competitive proposals; or (5) non-competitive.\n\nContract cost and price\n• Cost or price analysis: Recipients must perform a cost or price analysis in connection with every procurement action in excess of the Simplified Acquisition Threshold including contract modifications. The method and degree of analysis is dependent on the facts surrounding the particular procurement situation, but as a starting point, the non-Federal entity must make independent estimates before receiving bids or proposals.\n• Profit: Recipients must negotiate profit as a separate element of the price for each contract in which there is no price competition and in all cases where a cost analysis is performed. To establish a fair and reasonable profit, consideration must be given to the complexity of the work to be performed, the risk borne by the contractor, the contractor's investment, the amount of subcontracting, the quality of its record of past performance, and industry profit rates in the surrounding geographical area for similar work.\n• Estimated costs: Costs or prices based on estimated costs for contracts under the Federal award are allowable only to the extent that costs incurred or cost estimates included in negotiated prices would be allowable for the recipient under 2 CFR Part 200 Subpart E—Cost Principles. The non-Federal entity may reference its own cost principles that comply with the Federal cost principles.\n• Cost plus percentage of cost: The cost plus a percentage of cost and percentage of construction cost methods of contracting may not be used.\n\nBonding requirements\n• Bonding requirements: For construction or facility improvement contracts or subcontracts exceeding the Simplified Acquisition Threshold, FTA may accept the bonding policy and requirements of the non-Federal entity provided that FTA has made a determination that the Federal interest is adequately protected. If such a determination has not been made, the minimum requirements must be applied as follows:\n  o A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of the bid price. The \"bid guarantee\" must consist of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder will, upon acceptance of the bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within the time specified.\n  o A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A \"performance bond\" is one executed in connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's obligations under such contract.\n  o A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A \"payment bond\" is one executed in connection with a contract to assure payment as required by law of all persons supplying labor and material in the execution of the work provided for in the contract.\n\nContract provisions\n• Contract provisions: Recipient's contracts must contain the applicable provisions described in Appendix II to 2 CFR Part 200—Contract Provisions for non-Federal Entity Contracts Under Federal Awards, and any other provisions required under Federal law.\n\nNOTE TO REVIEWER ON APPLICATION OF BABA:\nA procurement funded by a Federal award obligated on or after November 10, 2022, must comply with the Build America, Buy America Act (BABA) requirements in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Pub. L. No. 117-58, div. G §§ 70901-17.\n\nNote on BABA implementation. A procurement funded by a Federal award obligated on or after November 10, 2022, must comply with the Build America, Buy America Act (BABA) requirements in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Pub. L. No. 117-58, div. G §§ 70901-17.\n\nFor many years, FTA's Buy America statute at 49 U.S.C. 5323(j) has, with some exceptions, required all steel, iron, and manufactured products used in a federally funded project to be produced in the United States. A principal effect of BABA is to add construction materials to this list of items. BABA does not change FTA's Buy America standards for steel, iron, or manufactured products including rolling stock (e.g., FTA does not apply the 55% cost-of-components standard to procurements).\n\nWhen BABA Applies:\nBABA's domestic preference for construction materials applies only to procurements funded by Federal awards obligated on or after November 10, 2022. If a procurement occurs under a Federal award that was obligated before November 10, 2022, BABA does not apply, even if the procurement occurs on or after that date. Additionally, On January 30, 2023, DOT announced a limited Waiver of Buy America Requirement for Construction Materials for Certain Contracts and Solicitations. Contracts and solicitations meeting the terms of the linked waiver are also exempt from the BABA construction materials requirement.\n\nWhat BABA Standard Applies:\nIn the course of implementing BABA's new requirements, the U.S. Office of Management and Budget has published more than one set of interpretations for applying BABA.\n\nOn April 18, 2022, OMB issued memorandum M-22-11, \"Initial Implementation Guidance on Application of Buy America Preference in Federal Financial Assistance Programs for Infrastructure,\" to guide federal agencies' initial implementation of BABA. OMB subsequently codified final guidance, with an effective date of October 23, 2023, at 2 CFR Part 184. Awards may be subject to either the Initial or Final BABA guidance based on the date of award execution:\n• Federal awards obligated on or after October 23, 2023, will apply 2 CFR Part 184.\n• Federal awards obligated on or after May 14, 2022 (the date BABA became effective by statute), and before October 23, 2023, will continue to apply OMB's Initial Implementation Guidance.\n• If a project that previously received a Federal award obligated on or after May 14, 2022, and before October 23, 2023, receives an additional Federal award obligated before October 23, 2024, the additional Federal award also will apply OMB's Initial Implementation Guidance.\n• Any Federal award obligated on or after October 23, 2024, will apply 2 CFR Part 184, regardless of whether 2 CFR Part 184 applied to previous awards for the project.\n\nFor procurements reviewed that contain deficiencies related to statutory or regulatory requirements that may deem the procurements ineligible for Federal funding, discuss the appropriate corrective action with the FTA regional office and regional counsel.\n\nOther requirements\n• Exclusionary or discriminatory specification: Federal funds may not be used to support a procurement that uses an exclusionary or discriminatory specification.\n• Buy America: Recipient's procurements must comply with Buy America requirements in 49 U.S.C. 5323(j) and 49 CFR Parts 661 and 663.",

The non-Federal entity's documented procurement procedures must conform to the procurement standards identified in §§ 200.317 through 200.327.\n\n(b)Non-Federal entities must maintain oversight to ensure that contractors perform in accordance with the terms, conditions, and specifications of their contracts or purchase orders.\n\n(c) (1) The non-Federal entity must maintain written standards of conduct covering conflicts of interest and governing the actions of its employees engaged in the selection, award and administration of contracts. No employee, officer, or agent may participate in the selection, award, or administration of a contract supported by a Federal award if he or she has a real or apparent conflict of interest. Such a conflict of interest would arise when the employee, officer, or agent, any member of his or her immediate family, his or her partner, or an organization which employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial or other interest in or a tangible personal benefit from a firm considered for a contract. The officers, employees, and agents of the non-Federal entity may neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors or parties to subcontracts. However, non-Federal entities may set standards for situations in which the financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal value. The standards of conduct must provide for disciplinary actions to be applied for violations of such standards by officers, employees, or agents of the non-Federal entity.\n\n(2)If the non-Federal entity has a parent, affiliate, or subsidiary organization that is not a State, local government, or Indian tribe, the non-Federal entity must also maintain written standards of conduct covering organizational conflicts of interest. Organizational conflicts of interest means that because of relationships with a parent company, affiliate, or subsidiary organization, the non-Federal entity is unable or appears to be unable to be impartial in conducting a procurement action involving a related organization.\n\n(d)The non-Federal entity's procedures must avoid acquisition of unnecessary or duplicative items. Consideration should be given to consolidating or breaking out procurements to obtain a more economical purchase. Where appropriate, an analysis will be made of lease versus purchase alternatives, and any other appropriate analysis to determine the most economical approach.\n\n(e)To foster greater economy and efficiency, and in accordance with efforts to promote cost-effective use of shared services across the Federal Government, the non-Federal entity is encouraged to enter into state and local intergovernmental agreements or inter-entity agreements where appropriate for procurement or use of common or shared goods and services. Competition requirements will be met with documented procurement actions using strategic sourcing, shared services, and other similar procurement arrangements.\n\n(f)The non-Federal entity is encouraged to use Federal excess and surplus property in lieu of purchasing new equipment and property whenever such use is feasible and reduces project costs.\n\n(g)The non-Federal entity is encouraged to use value engineering clauses in contracts for construction projects of sufficient size to offer reasonable opportunities for cost reductions. Value engineering is a systematic and creative analysis of each contract item or task to ensure that its essential function is provided at the overall lower cost.\n\n(h)The non-Federal entity must award contracts only to responsible contractors possessing the ability to perform successfully under the terms and conditions of a proposed procurement. Consideration will be given to such matters as contractor integrity, compliance with public policy, record of past performance, and financial and technical resources. See also § 200.214.\n\n(i)The non-Federal entity must maintain records sufficient to detail the history of procurement. These records will include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: Rationale for the method of procurement, selection of contract type, contractor selection or rejection, and the basis for the contract price.\n\n(j)(1) The non-Federal entity may use a time-and-materials type contract only after a determination that no other contract is suitable and if the contract includes a ceiling price that the contractor exceeds at its own risk. Time-and-materials type contract means a contract whose cost to a non-Federal entity is the sum of:\n\n(i)The actual cost of materials; and\n\n(ii)Direct labor hours charged at fixed hourly rates that reflect wages, general and administrative expenses, and profit.\n\n(2)Since this formula generates an open-ended contract price, a time-and-materials contract provides no positive profit incentive to the contractor for cost control or labor efficiency. Therefore, each contract must set a ceiling price that the contractor exceeds at its own risk. Further, the non-Federal entity awarding such a contract must assert a high degree of oversight in order to obtain reasonable assurance that the contractor is using efficient methods and effective cost controls.\n\n(k)The non-Federal entity alone must be responsible, in accordance with good administrative practice and sound business judgment, for the settlement of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements. These issues include, but are not limited to, source evaluation, protests, disputes, and claims. These standards do not relieve the non-Federal entity of any contractual responsibilities under its contracts. The Federal awarding agency will not substitute its judgment for that of the non-Federal entity unless the matter is primarily a Federal concern. Violations of law will be referred to the local, state, or Federal authority having proper jurisdiction."

Nothing in this section preempts state licensing laws. When contracting for architectural and engineering (A/E) services, geographic location may be a selection criterion provided its application leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project, to compete for the contract.\n\n(d)The non-Federal entity must have written procedures for procurement transactions. These procedures must ensure that all solicitations:\n\n(1)Incorporate a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product, or service to be procured. Such description must not, in competitive procurements, contain features which unduly restrict competition. The description may include a statement of the qualitative nature of the material, product or service to be procured and, when necessary, must set forth those minimum essential characteristics and standards to which it must conform if it is to satisfy its intended use. Detailed product specifications should be avoided if at all possible. When it is impractical or uneconomical to make a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements, a \"brand name or equivalent\" description may be used as a means to define the performance or other salient requirements of procurement. The specific features of the named brand which must be met by offers must be clearly stated; and\n\n(2)Identify all requirements which the offerors must fulfill and all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.\n\n(e)The non-Federal entity must ensure that all prequalified lists of persons, firms, or products which are used in acquiring goods and services are current and include enough qualified sources to ensure maximum open and free competition.

          "detailed_explanation": "49 U.S.C. Section 5325(j) requires recipients to make FTA-assisted contract awards only to \"responsible\" contractors possessing the ability to successfully perform under the terms and conditions of a proposed procurement. Before making an award to a contractor, a recipient shall consider the integrity of the contractor; the contractor's compliance with public policy; the contractor's past performance; and the contractor's financial and technical resources. The form and formality of the recipient's responsibility determination will be appropriate to the size, complexity, and risk of each particular procurement. It is a recommended practice to make a written responsibility determination for procurements above the simplified acquisition threshold. Responsibility is determined by the recipient after receiving bids or proposals and before making contract award.\n\nRecipients also are required to ensure before entering into a covered contract that the potential contractor and its principals are not suspended, debarred, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation in federally assisted transactions or procurements. This applies to any contract, regardless of tier, that is awarded by a contractor, subcontractor, supplier, consultant, or its agent or representative in any transaction, if the contract is to be funded or provided by the Department of Transportation. For each third party contract expected to equal or exceed $25,000, recipients must verify that the bidder is not excluded or disqualified by:\n\n• Checking System for Award Management (SAM) Exclusions (at SAM.gov); or\n• Collecting a certification; or\n• Adding a clause or condition to the covered transaction\n\nFTA notes that affirmative actions, such as checking SAM.gov or including a requirement for a signed certification, are preferred. A best practice is for the recipient to print the screen with the results of the search to include in the award or procurement file, or to have a checklist noting when the SAM was reviewed.\n\n2 CFR 180.995 defines a principal, in part, as an officer, director, owner, partner, principal investigator, or other person with management or supervisory responsibilities related to a covered transaction; or a consultant or other person, whether or not employed by the contractor or paid with Federal funds, who is in a position to handle federal funds, influence or control the use of those funds, or who occupies a technical or professional position capable of substantially influencing the development or outcome of an activity required to perform the covered transaction.\n\nIn the event that a recipient becomes aware that an excluded party is participating in a covered transaction, it must promptly inform the FTA regional office in writing of this information. The recipient may continue any covered transaction in existence at the time a party becomes excluded. The recipient is not required to continue the transaction and may consider termination. However, the recipient may not renew or extend the covered transaction (other than through a fully documented no-cost time extension) with the excluded party without FTA's approval.",

          "applicability": "All recipients",
          "detailed_explanation": "Recipients are required to conduct all procurement transactions in a manner that provides full and open competition. Full and open competition means that all responsible sources are permitted to compete. Recipients must comply with geographic preference restrictions and prequalification requirements.\n\nGeographic Preferences:\nRecipients must conduct procurements in a manner that prohibits the use of statutorily or administratively imposed geographic preferences in the evaluation of bids or proposals, except in those cases where applicable Federal statutes expressly mandate or encourage geographic preference. Exceptions include:\n\n• Architectural and Engineering (A&E) Services. When contracting for A&E services, geographic location may be a selection criterion, provided that its application leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project, to compete for the contract. Recipient should ensure that their use does not restrict competition (i.e., the use of geographic preference leaves only one or two qualified firms to bid on the contract).\n• Licensing. A state may enforce its licensing requirements, provided that those requirements do not conflict with Federal law.\n• Major Disaster or Emergency Relief. Federal assistance awarded under the Stafford Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 5150, to support contracts and agreements for debris clearance, distribution of supplies, reconstruction, and other major disaster or emergency assistance activities permits a preference, to the extent feasible and practicable, for organizations, firms, and individuals residing or doing business primarily in an area affected by a major disaster or emergency.\n• Section 418 of the fiscal year (FY) 2015 Appropriations Act and Section 415 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, Public Law 114-113 (FY 2016 Appropriations Act) prohibit FTA from using FY2015 or FY2016 funds to implement, administer, or enforce the prohibition of geographic preferences under 49 CFR 18.36(c)(2) (now 2 CFR 200.319(b)) for construction hiring purposes. \"Construction hiring purposes\" means hiring of the construction labor workforce for a construction project. Section 418 applies to all FTA awards, including awards funded under the Hurricane Sandy Emergency Relief and Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) programs. Recipients are asked to provide the FTA Regional Office notice of using local hiring preferences on construction projects.\n• The Department of Transportation Appropriations Act, 2019, Pub. L. 116-6, §191, allows geographic, economic, and other hiring preferences if the recipient makes certain certifications regarding available unemployed workforce, displacement of workers, and added costs of using preferences.\n\nSection 25019 of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Pub. L. 117-58, authorizes all recipients to implement a local or other geographical or economic hiring preference relating to the use of labor for construction of a project, including prehire agreements, subject to any applicable State and local laws, policies, and procedures.\n\nPrequalification Lists:\nExcept for purchases below the simplified acquisition threshold, proposals or bids must be publicly solicited from an adequate number of sources. Recipients are prohibited from restricting competition in federally supported procurement transactions. Recipients are not required to prequalify potential bidders. However, recipients that place such a requirement on potential bidders must adhere to federal requirements. If a recipient requires prospective bidders to prequalify, it must ensure that all lists of prequalified persons, firms, or products that are used in acquiring goods and services are current and include enough qualified sources to ensure maximum open and free competition. Recipients must permit potential bidders or offerors to qualify during the solicitation period (from the issuance of the solicitation to its closing date). Prequalification should not be confused with reviews of technical qualifications that are an essential process in two-step and qualifications-based procurements.\n\nFLEXIBILITIES AND ADMINISTRATIVE RELIEF\n\nEligible Operations or Maintenance Expenses\nUnder the authority of the Emergency Relief program to set the necessary terms and conditions of an award (49 USC 5324 (d)(1)), FTA permits funds to be used for operations and maintenance expenses incurred after January 20, 2020, even if the original contract did not meet all Federal requirements. The procurement of any new contracts would need to follow all Federal requirements.\n\nFull and Open Competition\nThere are some flexibilities permitted under OMB Memo M-20-17 to allow recipients to waive the procurement requirements regarding geographical preferences [2 CFR 200.319(c)] and contracting small and minority businesses, women's business enterprises, and labor surplus area firms [200.321]. FTA recipients should document any procurement decisions made in response to the COVID-19 public health emergency and may be asked to provide that information in the future. This flexibility is for procurement activity from March 1, 2020 through March 1, 2021. As required under 2 CFR part 200, when procuring property and services under a federal award, states must follow the same policies and procedures it uses for procurements from its non-federal funds, including any provisions for emergency situations.",

Obtain and review the listing of FTA-funded procurements.\n\nDuring the site visit:\n\n• Review procurement files, particularly legal notices and solicitation documents, to determine whether procurements were unreasonably restrictive. If a procurement only received one or two responses, did the specifications include non-essential requirements that only a single manufacturer can meet? Did potential bidders submit pre-submission questions regarding compliance with the specifications or other contract requirements? Examine any bid protests and any questions and answers to solicitations to determine if there are any perceived restrictions from potential bidders.\n\n• When using outside sources, the recipient should take appropriate steps to prevent or mitigate organizational conflicts of interest that would result in conflicting roles that might bias a contractor's judgment or would result in unfair competitive advantage. Through review of procurement procedures and interviews with the recipient, determine if there is a process to mitigate organizational conflicts of interest. Review selected procurement files to determine if there were any potential organizational conflicts of interest and how the recipient mitigated the conflict.\n\n• Review procurement files for use of geographic preferences outside of the allowable exceptions. Examine any bid protests and any questions and answers to solicitations to determine if there are any potential geographic preference issues. These may include bid/evaluation preferences for, or restricting competition to, in-state or local firms. In-state licensing requirements do not constitute geographic preference. When contracting for A&E services, geographic location may be a selection criterion provided its application leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project, to compete for the contract.\n\n• Review procurement files, particularly legal notices and solicitation documents, to determine whether responses to procurements are limited to pre-qualified firms. If a recipient requires prospective bidders to prequalify, determine if it has documented that it has ensured that all prequalification lists include enough sources to ensure full and open competition. Determine if the recipient permitted potential bidders or offerors to qualify during the solicitation period (from the issuance of the solicitation to its closing date).\n\nFLEXIBILITIES AND ADMINISTRATIVE RELIEF\n\nDiscuss with the recipient if it has used geographic preferences in procurements due to the COVID-19 public health emergency. If yes, determine if the transaction occurred within the allowed time period of March 1, 2020, through March 1, 2021.",

          "question": "Did the recipient appropriately use each method of procurement as described in its policies and procedures and in compliance with 2 CFR Part 200?",
          "basic_requirement": "The non-Federal entity must appropriately use one of the following methods of procurement: micro-purchase, simplified acquisition, sealed bid, competitive proposals or non-competitive proposals.",
          "applicability": "All recipients",
          "detailed_explanation": "Micro-purchases may be made without obtaining competitive quotations if the recipient determines that the price to be paid is fair and reasonable. These purchases must be distributed equitably among qualified suppliers to the extent practicable, and must not be split to avoid the requirements for competition above the micro-purchase threshold.\n\nSimplified acquisition procedures require that price or rate quotations be obtained from an adequate number of qualified sources (at least two). The solicitations and quotations may be either oral or written, but must be evidenced in the recipient's records.\n\nFor procurements exceeding the Federal simplified acquisition threshold (currently $250,000), sealed bids or competitive proposals are generally required.\n\n• Sealed Bids/IFB – Bids are publicly solicited and the award is made to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming with all the material terms and conditions of the invitation for bids, is the lowest in price.\n\n• Competitive Proposals/RFP – Proposals are publicly solicited from an adequate number of sources and the award is made to the responsive and responsible proposer whose offer is most advantageous to the recipient, with price and other factors considered. Requests for proposals must be publicized and identify all evaluation factors and their relative importance.\n\nNon-competitive procurements: There are specific circumstances in which noncompetitive procurement can be used. Noncompetitive procurement can only be awarded if one or more of the following circumstances apply:\n\n• Micropurchase: The acquisition of property or services, the aggregate dollar amount of which does not exceed the micro-purchase threshold (see above).\n\n• Sole source. The item is available only from a single source. This may occur, for example, when only one offeror owns certain patent or restricted data rights necessary to the recipient; or the award is a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the recipient that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.\n\n• Exigent circumstances. The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not permit a delay resulting from publicizing a competitive solicitation. Generally, this exception to competition will allow a recipient to procure only the goods or services needed to deal with the exigency or emergency. (For example, in the case of a leaking roof, a contract for temporary repairs may be sufficient to \"get past\" the exigency, as compared to a procurement for an entire roof replacement.)\n\n• Federal authorization. The Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity expressly authorizes a noncompetitive procurement in response to a written request from the recipient.\n\n• Inadequate competition. After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate.\n\nWhile professional services can be procured on a sole-source basis if justified, in general, a competitive environment does exist for professional services and the recipient needs to provide for competition when FTA funds are used to pay for these services.\n\nWith a single bid, the documentation should include a cost analysis, as well as an explanation as to why only a single bid was received. Upon receiving a single bid or proposal in response to a competitive solicitation, the recipient should determine if its solicitation was unduly restrictive. This could include actions such as a review of the specifications for undue restrictiveness, a survey of potential sources that chose not to submit a bid or proposal, or other actions.\n\nTime-and-materials contracts are a restricted type of procurement. They are contracts in which the contractor charges a single rate that includes overhead and profit for labor, and materials are billed at cost. Generally, the total value of a time and materials type contract is an indeterminate amount. As such, recipients are not permitted to use FTA funds for time-and-materials type contracts unless it determines that no other type of contract is suitable for the procurement. If time-and-materials type contracts are used, recipients must specify a ceiling price that the contractor shall not exceed, except at its own risk.\n\nFLEXIBILITIES AND ADMINISTRATIVE RELIEF\n\nEligible Operations or Maintenance Expenses\nUnder the authority of the Emergency Relief program to set the necessary terms and conditions of an award (49 USC 5324 (d)(1), FTA permits funds to be used for operations and maintenance expenses incurred after January 20, 2020, even if the original contract did not meet all Federal requirements. The procurement of any new contracts would need to follow all Federal requirements.\n\nMethods of Procurement\nFederal procurement standards established in 2 CFR part 220.318-327 permit the use of a noncompetitive procurement when the circumstances of an emergency (or public exigency) would not permit a delay resulting from competitive solicitation.",

These procurements are reviewed in the following question.\n\nNon-competitive procurement: Review selected procurements to determine if one or more of the following conditions was met:\n• The acquisition of property or services, the aggregate dollar amount of which does not exceed the micro-purchase threshold (see paragraph (a)(1) of this section);\n• The item is available only from a single source;\n• The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not permit a delay resulting from publicizing a competitive solicitation;\n• The Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity expressly authorizes a noncompetitive procurement in response to a written request from the non-Federal entity; or\n• After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate.\n\nDetermine if the recipient included a written noncompetitive procurement justification in its procurement file.\n\nSingle bidder: Ask the recipient to provide information on recipient's requirements for advertisement/dissemination of solicitation. Review any advertisement/dissemination procedures in the recipient's procurement policies. Review selected procurements to determine if the procurement files include an explanation as to why a single bid was obtained and if the recipient's determination of adequate competition included a review of the specifications for undue restrictiveness. Reviewing a solicitation for undue restrictiveness may include a survey of potential sources that chose not to submit a bid or proposal, and a review of whether the solicitation was adequately advertised and open for a sufficient period of time given the complexity of the project.\n\nTime and materials: Prior to the site visit, examine the procurement listing provided by the recipient to determine if any time-and-materials type contracts were awarded during the review period.

When the value of the procurement for property or services under a Federal award does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (SAT), as defined in § 200.1, or a lower threshold established by a non-Federal entity, formal procurement methods are not required. The non-Federal entity may use informal procurement methods to expedite the completion of its transactions and minimize the associated administrative burden and cost. The informal methods used for procurement of property or services at or below the SAT include:\n\n(1) Micro-purchases -\n(i)Distribution. The acquisition of supplies or services, the aggregate dollar amount of which does not exceed the micro-purchase threshold (See the definition of micro-purchase in § 200.1). To the maximum extent practicable, the non-Federal entity should distribute micro-purchases equitably among qualified suppliers.\n(ii)Micro-purchase awards. Micro-purchases may be awarded without soliciting competitive price or rate quotations if the non-Federal entity considers the price to be reasonable based on research, experience, purchase history or other information and documents it files accordingly. Purchase cards can be used for micro-purchases if procedures are documented and approved by the non-Federal entity.\n(iii)Micro-purchase thresholds. The non-Federal entity is responsible for determining and documenting an appropriate micro-purchase threshold based on internal controls, an evaluation of risk, and its documented procurement procedures. The micro-purchase threshold used by the non-Federal entity must be authorized or not prohibited under State, local, or tribal laws or regulations. Non-Federal entities may establish a threshold higher than the Federal threshold established in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1)(iv) and (v) of this section.\n(iv) Non-Federal entity increase to the micro-purchase threshold up to $50,000. Non-Federal entities may establish a threshold higher than the micro-purchase threshold identified in the FAR in accordance with the requirements of this section. The non-Federal entity may self-certify a threshold up to $50,000 on an annual basis and must maintain documentation to be made available to the Federal awarding agency and auditors in accordance with § 200.334. The self-certification must include a justification, clear identification of the threshold, and supporting documentation of any of the following:\n(A)A qualification as a low-risk auditee, in accordance with the criteria in § 200.520 for the most recent audit;\n(B)An annual internal institutional risk assessment to identify, mitigate, and manage financial risks; or,\n(C)For public institutions, a higher threshold consistent with State law.\n(v) Non-Federal entity increase to the micro-purchase threshold over $50,000. Micro-purchase thresholds higher than $50,000 must be approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. The non-federal entity must submit a request with the requirements included in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section. The increased threshold is valid until there is a change in status in which the justification was approved.\n\n(2) Simplified acquisitions -\n(i) Simplified acquisition procedures. The acquisition of property or services, the aggregate dollar amount of which is higher than the micro-purchase threshold but does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. If simplified acquisition procedures are used, price or rate quotations must be obtained from an adequate number of qualified sources as determined appropriate by the non-Federal entity.\n(ii)Simplified acquisition thresholds. The non-Federal entity is responsible for determining an appropriate simplified acquisition threshold based on internal controls, an evaluation of risk and its documented procurement procedures which must not exceed the threshold established in the FAR. When applicable, a lower simplified acquisition threshold used by the non-Federal entity must be authorized or not prohibited under State, local, or tribal laws or regulations.\n\n(b)Formal procurement methods. When the value of the procurement for property or services under a Federal financial assistance award exceeds the SAT, or a lower threshold established by a non-Federal entity, formal procurement methods are required. Formal procurement methods require following documented procedures. Formal procurement methods also require public advertising unless a non-competitive procurement can be used in accordance with § 200.319 or paragraph (c) of this section. The following formal methods of procurement are used for procurement of property or services above the simplified acquisition threshold or a value below the simplified acquisition threshold the non-Federal entity determines to be appropriate:\n\n(1)Sealed bids. A procurement method in which bids are publicly solicited and a firm fixed-price contract (lump sum or unit price) is awarded to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming with all the material terms and conditions of the invitation for bids, is the lowest in price. The sealed bids method is the preferred method for procuring construction, if the conditions.\n(i)In order for sealed bidding to be feasible, the following conditions should be present:\n(A)A complete, adequate, and realistic specification or purchase description is available;\n(B)Two or more responsible bidders are willing and able to compete effectively for the business; and\n(C)The procurement lends itself to a firm fixed price contract and the selection of the successful bidder can be made principally on the basis of price.\n(ii)If sealed bids are used, the following requirements apply:\n(A)Bids must be solicited from an adequate number of qualified sources, providing them sufficient response time prior to the date set for opening the bids, for local, and tribal governments, the invitation for bids must be publicly advertised;\n(B)The invitation for bids, which will include any specifications and pertinent attachments, must define the items or services in order for the bidder to properly respond;\n(C)All bids will be opened at the time and place prescribed in the invitation for bids, and for local and tribal governments, the bids must be opened publicly;\n(D)A firm fixed price contract award will be made in writing to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder. Where specified in bidding documents, factors such as discounts, transportation cost, and life cycle costs must be considered in determining which bid is lowest. Payment discounts will only be used to determine the low bid when prior experience indicates that such discounts are usually taken advantage of; and\n(E)Any or all bids may be rejected if there is a sound documented reason.\n\n(2)Proposals. A procurement method in which either a fixed price or cost-reimbursement type contract is awarded. Proposals are generally used when conditions are not appropriate for the use of sealed bids. They are awarded in accordance with the following requirements:\n(i)Requests for proposals must be publicized and identify all evaluation factors and their relative importance. Proposals must be solicited from an adequate number of qualified offerors. Any response to publicized requests for proposals must be considered to the maximum extent practical;\n(ii)The non-Federal entity must have a written method for conducting technical evaluations of the proposals received and making selections;\n(iii)Contracts must be awarded to the responsible offeror whose proposal is most advantageous to the non-Federal entity, with price and other factors considered; and\n(iv)The non-Federal entity may use competitive proposal procedures for qualifications-based procurement of architectural/engineering (A/E) professional services whereby offeror's qualifications are evaluated and the most qualified offeror is selected, subject to negotiation of fair and reasonable compensation. The method, where price is not used as a selection factor, can only be used in procurement of A/E professional services. It cannot be used to purchase other types of services though A/E firms that are a potential source to perform the proposed effort.\n\n(c)Noncompetitive procurement. There are specific circumstances in which noncompetitive procurement can be used. Noncompetitive procurement can only be awarded if one or more of the following circumstances apply:\n(1)The acquisition of property or services, the aggregate dollar amount of which does not exceed the micro-purchase threshold (see paragraph (a)(1) of this section);\n(2)The item is available only from a single source;\n(3)The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not permit a delay resulting from publicizing a competitive solicitation;\n(4)The Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity expressly authorizes a noncompetitive procurement in response to a written request from the non-Federal entity; or\n(5)After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate."

This method is not to be used for procuring services other than A&E.",

          "detailed_explanation": "A&E services include program management, architectural engineering, construction management, a feasibility study, and preliminary engineering, design, architectural, engineering, surveying, mapping, or related services. FTA guidance suggests that 49 U.S.C. Section 5325(b) authorizes the use of qualifications-based procurement procedures only for services that directly relate or lead to construction, alteration, or repair of real property. A recipient may not use qualifications-based procurement procedures to acquire non-A&E services, even if those non-A&E services will be or could be provided by an A&E firm. For design/build and similar procurements, FTA expects the recipient to use the procurement method appropriate for the services having the greater cost, even though the other necessary services would not typically be procured by that method.\n\nWhen using FTA assistance to contract for A&E services, recipients, including states, are required to use competitive proposal procedures based on the Brooks Act or an equivalent qualifications-based requirement of a State adopted before August 10, 2005.\n\nFor qualifications-based procurements under the Brooks Act, price must not be considered during the selection phase of the most qualified offeror. Offerors' qualifications are evaluated to determine the most qualified offeror. Price is then negotiated with the most qualified firm. If an agreement cannot be reached, then the recipient may negotiate with the next most qualified firm and so on until an agreement is reached on a price that the recipient determines is fair and reasonable.\n\nRecipients may make multiple awards to cover needs for various disciplines under an \"on-call\" type of contract. Under this type of contract, the recipient selects the most qualified firm for each discipline (e.g., architect, seismic engineer). When the recipient has a project that needs an A&E firm, the recipient negotiates price with the most qualified firm only. On-call contracts may be suited for smaller jobs that would be too expensive (administratively) to compete individually. An on-call A&E contract means that the recipient has identified the most qualified firm and has entered into a contract with that firm for future A&E work, as needed.\n\nA recipient is not precluded from making multiple awards for A&E services, however the selection of contractors and placement of orders must be consistent with Brooks Act qualification based selection procedures. Solicitations that will result in multiple awards should describe how orders will be assigned to the successful firms, and not leave the process undefined.",

The method and degree of analysis is dependent on the facts surrounding the particular procurement situation, but as a starting point, the recipient must make independent estimates before receiving bids or proposals. Generally a cost analysis must be performed for: (1) procurements which require that offerors submit detailed elements of direct and indirect costs; (2) procurements where adequate price competition is lacking; or (3) noncompetitive procurements, unless price reasonableness can be established based on market prices. Price analysis (i.e., using catalog or market prices) may be performed for all other procurements.\n\nThe independent cost estimate (ICE) is a tool to assist in determining the reasonableness of the bid or proposal being evaluated; that is, to assist in performing the cost or price analysis. An ICE is the starting point for conducting a cost or price analysis. It is required for all procurements exceeding the Federal simplified acquisition threshold. An ICE is completed prior to receipt of bids or proposals. It can range from a simple budgetary estimate to a complex estimate based on items like drawings, specifications, and information from previous procurements. The word \"independent\" means that the estimate is prepared without the influence of persons who have a financial interest in or will be considered for the resulting award. It does not imply that it is performed by someone other than the recipient. This could be the case, however, if the recipient does not have the expertise for a large complex procurement.\n\nThe ICE is especially critical whenever there is no price competition, or where offerors are submitting price proposals for goods or services that are not exactly comparable (e.g., for procurements of high-technology items or professional services).

          "applicability": "All recipients",
          "detailed_explanation": "Transit Vehicle Manufacturer (TVM) Certification: As part of their DBE program, all recipients must require that each TVM, as a condition of being authorized to bid on transit vehicle procurements funded by FTA, certify that it has complied with the requirements of 49 CFR 26.49. Only those TVMs listed on FTA's certified list or that have submitted a goal methodology to FTA that has been approved or has not been disapproved at the time of solicitation are eligible to bid. The recipient is required to include a provision in its bid specifications requiring the TVM certification as a condition of permission to bid. The certification should reference 49 CFR Part 26 (not Part 23).\n\nA list of certified TVMs is available at the FTA website: https://www.transit.dot.gov/regulations-and-guidance/civil-rights-ada/eligible-transit-vehicle-manufacturers. Prior to award, evidence that this website has been checked or evidence of communication with FTA's Office of Civil Rights to validate TVM certification, must be documented.\n\nThe TVM definition is codified at 49 CFR 26.5. Note that producers of vehicles that receive post-production alterations or retrofitting to be used for public transportation purposes (e.g., so-called cutaway vehicles, vans customized for service to people with disabilities) are also considered to be TVMs. Further, to the extent to which a vehicle remanufacturer is responding to a solicitation for new or remanufactured vehicles with a vehicle to which the remanufacturer has provided post-production alterations or retro-fitting, that remanufacturer is considered a TVM. Businesses that manufacture, mass-produce, or distribute vehicles solely for personal use are not considered TVMs.\n\nLobbying Certification: Recipients are required to include a lobbying certification in agreements, contracts, and subcontracts exceeding $100,000. Signed certifications regarding lobbying must be obtained by the recipient from potential contractors with the contractors' bids. This requirement flows down. The recipient must require its prime contractors to obtain certifications from bidders for subcontracts in excess of $100,000, and so on for all contracting tiers. Lobbying certifications are retained at the contracting tier to which they are submitted, and are not forwarded to higher contracting tiers. The lobbying certification is a separate requirement from lobbying disclosures a contractor may have to submit.\n\nBuy America Certification: Buy America regulations require that all steel, iron, manufactured products, and construction materials used in the project are produced in the United States. Solicitations for steel, iron, and manufactured products must contain a Buy America certification, unless the procurement is subject to a waiver. As of December 2023, FTA's Buy America regulation does not require a certification for construction materials, but FTA strongly recommends recipients choose to add construction materials to their certifications. Buy America requirements also apply to capital leases for rolling stock and related equipment. Buy America requirements applicable to rolling stock procurements are discussed in more detail in question P20.\n\nThe 2015 FAST Act codified a small-purchase waiver for iron, steel, and manufactured products at 49 U.S.C. 5323(j)(13). The term \"small purchase\" means a purchase of not more than $150,000. This value is set in statute and does not change with inflation. According to a September 16, 2016, Dear Colleague letter, FTA interprets the small-purchase waiver to apply to purchases of iron, steel, or manufactured products of $150,000 or less, regardless of the size of the project. The value of a purchase is not just the value of the goods subject to Buy America, but is the total purchase price inclusive of non-BA goods, labor, warranties, options, and so forth. The waiver applies to purchases made directly by recipients or subrecipients and to purchases made by contractors on behalf of the recipient or subrecipient. A recipient may not break up procurements into smaller purchases in order to come under the $150,000 threshold. If a solicitation may result in bids near $150,000, the recipient should include the Buy America certifications in the solicitation, with a note clarifying that if the bid is more than $150,000, the bidder must certify per the Buy America requirements, but if the bid is $150,000 or less, no certification will be necessary.",

For transit vehicle procurements, recipients must verify that the manufacturer is an eligible Transit Vehicle Manufacturer (TVM) at the time of bid or proposal submission. For procurements over $100,000, recipients must obtain lobbying certifications. For procurements of steel, iron, manufactured products, or construction materials, recipients must obtain Buy America certifications unless a waiver applies.",
          "applicability": "All recipients",
          "detailed_explanation": "The small-purchase waiver applies only to domestic preferences established by 49 U.S.C. 5323(j). In other words, the small-purchase waiver applies only to steel, iron, and manufactured products. It does not apply to construction materials, the domestic preference for which is established under a separate authority, the Build America, Buy America Act.\n\nIn August 2023, the U.S. Department of Transportation published a Department-wide Waiver of Buy America Requirements for De Minimis Costs and Small Grants, 88 Fed. Reg. 55817 (Aug. 16, 2023). This waiver is separate from the small purchase waiver. It applies to FTA awards obligated on or after August 16, 2023. The waiver waives Buy America requirements for steel, iron, manufactured products, and construction materials under a single financial assistance award for which:\n• Costs of non-compliant products are de minimis (meaning, the total value of the non-compliant products is no more than the lesser of $1,000,000 or 5% of total applicable costs for the project); or\n• The total amount of Federal financial assistance applied to the project, through awards or subawards, is less than $500,000.\n\nThe De Minimis Costs waiver does not apply to products for which FTA or DOT has issued a product-specific waiver. This includes, for example, vehicles addressed by FTA's Partial Buy America Waiver for Vans and Minivans, 87 Fed. Reg. 64534 (Oct. 25, 2022).\n\nAdditionally, to ease the transition to applying Buy America to construction materials, DOT has issued multiple waivers of the construction materials requirement that may apply based on the date FTA obligated funding for a project or the date a recipient solicited or awarded a contract for construction materials:\n• Under DOT's Temporary Waiver of Buy America Requirements for Construction Materials, 87 Fed. Reg. 31931 (May 25, 2022), the construction materials requirement begins applying only with FTA financial assistance obligated on or after November 10, 2022.\n• DOT's Waiver of Buy America Requirements for Construction Materials for Certain Contracts and Solicitations (Jan. 30, 2023) (available on DOT's website) waives the construction materials requirement for certain contracts a recipient entered into between May 14, 2022, and March 10, 2023, depending on when FTA awarded assistance for the project and when the recipient solicited the contract. In all cases, waived construction materials must be delivered before October 1, 2024.\n• DOT's Waiver of Buy America Requirements for the Pacific Island Territories and the Freely Associated States (April 29, 2024) (available on DOT's website) waives the domestic preferences for iron, steel, manufactured products, and construction materials used in projects in the Pacific Island Territories (Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and American Samoa) and the Freely Associated States (the Republic of Palau, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Federated States of Micronesia). The waiver applies to all FTA awards obligated from April 29, 2024, to March 1, 2025.\n\nBuy America applies to:\n• All purchases of steel, iron, manufactured products, and construction materials, unless a waiver applies;\n• Contractors and subcontractors,\n• Purchases made using an intergovernmental agreement and jointly purchased manufactured products, and\n• Purchases of used items.\n\nFor all procurements not covered by the Small Grant waiver, or Pacific Island Territories waiver, the recipient shall include in its bid or request for proposal an appropriate notice of the Buy America provision. Such specifications shall require, as a condition of responsiveness, that the bidder or offeror submit with the bid or offer a completed Buy America certificate in accordance with 49 CFR 661.6 or 661.12, as appropriate. Recipients should include only the applicable Buy America certification. Inclusion of certifications for both rolling stock and non-rolling stock procurements is discouraged and may result in confusion on the part of the contractor as to the applicable Buy America requirements.\n\nRecipients may not obtain signed Buy America certifications after contract award for its own contracts or contracts of other recipients to make the contracts eligible for Federal funding. Recipients may, however, obtain signed Buy America certifications before buying off state GSA-type contracts to make them eligible for Federal funding.\n\nIf a bidder or offeror cannot certify compliance with Buy America requirements, the recipient must seek a waiver of the Buy America statute before it may award the contract to the bidder or offeror. Buy America waivers are available on one of the following grounds: applying Buy America requirements would be inconsistent with the public interest; the goods produced in the United States are not produced in a sufficient and reasonably available quantity or are not of a satisfactory quality (i.e., non-availability waiver); or including domestic material will increase the cost of the overall project by more than 25 percent.\n\nFLEXIBILITIES AND ADMINISTRATIVE RELIEF\n\nEligible Operations or Maintenance Expenses\n\nUnder the authority of the Emergency Relief program to set the necessary terms and conditions of an award (49 USC 5324 (d)(1)), FTA permits funds to be used for operations and maintenance expenses incurred after January 20, 2020, even if the original contract did not meet all Federal requirements. The procurement of any new contracts would need to follow all Federal requirements.",

Consequently: (a) Buses. A recipient: 1. May enter into a multi-year contract to acquire buses or replacement parts, with an option not exceeding five (5) years to buy additional buses or replacement parts, 49 U.S.C. Section 5325(e)(1)(A), but 2. May not exercise the option to acquire buses or replacement parts later than five (5) years after the date of its original contract. (b) Rail.

The underlying contract must include an assignability clause clearly describing the assignor-recipient's right to assign contract rights to the assignee-recipient; or, that the vendor be made a party to the assignment.",
          "applicability": "All recipients",
          "detailed_explanation": "For reasons of economy, FTA permits the assignment of unneeded contract rights or options. This practice is sometimes called \"piggybacking.\" FTA discourages the assignment of another recipient's contract rights as a substitute for a stand-alone procurement. Assignments are intended to be used only when a recipient has inadvertently acquired contract rights in excess of its needs due to changed circumstances or honest mistakes.\n\nIntentionally procuring excessive quantities using Federal money is a violation of Federal regulations. Furthermore, to the extent that an improper assignment of contract rights enables an assignee to avoid otherwise required procurement procedures, it also undermines the requirement for full and open competition in federally assisted procurements.\n\nWhile it is popular for recipients to acquire vehicles through this method of procurement, piggybacking can also occur for purchases of services and property. A recipient that obtains contractual rights through assignment may use them after first determining that the contract price remains fair and reasonable, and the contract provisions are adequate for compliance with all Federal requirements. The recipient need not perform a second price analysis if a price analysis was performed for the original contract. However, FTA expects the recipient to determine whether the contract price or prices originally established are still fair and reasonable before using those rights.\n\nFTA expects the recipient seeking the assignment to review the original contract to be sure that the quantities the assigning recipient acquired, coupled with the quantities the acquiring recipient seeks, do not exceed the amounts available under the assigning recipient's contract. Otherwise, the purchase is a \"tag-on\" (as defined below) and is considered an improper sole source procurement.\n\nAny changes in the vehicle when assigned must be within the original scope (i.e., no major changes in configuration or design). FTA has not developed a finite list of acceptable contract changes. In the case of rolling stock, a major change in quantity or a substitution of major end items not contemplated when competition for the original award took place would generally be a cardinal change. Another cardinal change includes a change from a high-floor to a low-floor vehicle. Changing an engine might result in a cardinal change depending on the circumstances surrounding the project and whether a compatible replacement could be obtained through competition. FTA, however, considers changes to seating, fabrics, colors, exterior paint schemes, signage, floor covering, and other similar items to be permissible changes.\n\nFor purposes of Buy America, the domestic content of the option vehicles is determined based on the delivery date of the first production option vehicle. If the domestic content percentage is lower than the domestic content percentage requirement the assignee-recipient would be subject to if it conducted a competition in the open market, the options exercised by the assignee-recipient will be ineligible for Federal reimbursement. A manufacturer may not agree to amend the contract to provide for a higher domestic content in order to permit a recipient to piggyback on an existing contract. Such an amendment is considered a cardinal change to the original contract.\n\nVehicles added to the base or option amounts originally specified are called \"tag-ons.\" Tag-ons are not permitted. A tag-on is defined as the adding on to the contracted quantities (base or option) as originally advertised, competed, and awarded, whether for the use of the buyer or for others, and then treating the add-on portion as though it met the requirements of competition.\n\nIf a recipient is using another recipient's procurement contract for purchasing revenue vehicles (i.e., \"piggybacking\"), the purchaser may rely on the pre-award audit completed prior to the original contract. However, the recipient must review the audit and prepare its own certifications to verify compliance with Buy America.",

          "basic_requirement": "A recipient purchasing revenue service rolling stock with Federal funds must conduct pre-award and post-delivery audits verifying compliance with Buy America provisions, purchaser's requirements, resident inspector requirements, and Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS).",
          "applicability": "All recipients",
          "detailed_explanation": "A recipient purchasing revenue service rolling stock with Federal funds must conduct pre-award and post-delivery audits verifying compliance with Buy America provisions, purchaser's requirements, resident inspector requirements, and FMVSS. The recipient is required to keep records, including pre-award and post-delivery certifications, which show that the regulations have been followed. The audits require the recipient to complete two certifications (Buy America and Purchaser's Requirements) at the pre-award stage and three certifications (Buy America, Purchaser's Requirements, and FMVSS) at the post-delivery stage. The regulations do not require that these five certifications have a human signature to be effective, however the certifications must convey that requirements have been reviewed and met.\n\nAlthough procurements of rolling stock of $150,000 or less are not subject to Buy America requirements, these contracts still must comply with the pre-award and post-delivery purchaser's requirements and FMVSS audits required by 49 CFR Part 663.\n\nPre-Award Audits and Certifications\n\nRecipients may purchase vehicles in several groups over several years using either vehicle procurement contracts with options or multi-year vehicle procurement contracts. FTA requires that each group of vehicles purchased, i.e., each \"order\" of vehicles, have a pre-award audit before the order is placed. One pre-award audit may suffice, provided that there is no change in vehicle configuration, i.e., no change that is expected to have a significant impact on vehicle handling and stability or structural integrity, between successive deliveries of vehicles.\n\nIf a recipient is using another recipient's procurement contract for purchasing revenue vehicles (i.e., \"piggybacking\") the purchaser may rely on the pre-award audit completed prior to the original contract. However, the recipient must review the audit and prepare its own certification. (Note: This requirement also applies to purchases off a State or GSA-type contract.).\n\nCompliance with purchaser's specifications: The recipient must complete a pre-award purchaser's requirements certification verifying that the manufacturers bid specifications comply with the recipient's solicitation requirements and that the proposed manufacturer is responsible and capable of building the bus to the solicitation specifications. The pre-award certification may be based on the recipient's determination that the vendor is responsive and responsible. The requirement to conduct an audit for compliance with purchaser's requirements and complete a certification applies to all purchases of revenue rolling stock, even those below the Federal Simplified Acquisition Threshold. The pre-award audit is required before a recipient enters into a formal contract with a supplier.\n\nCompliance with Buy America: If the procurement is more than $150,000, at the pre-award stage, the recipient must complete:\n• A compliance certification verifying that the rolling stock will contain the required minimum percent domestic components, by cost, and that final assembly will take place in the United States; or\n• An exemption certification indicating that the recipient has a letter from FTA granting a waiver from the Buy America requirement.\n\nThe recipient or an independent third party must conduct the Buy America audit. The audit may be based on information provided by the manufacturer; however, certification by the manufacturer is not adequate.\n\nFor rolling stock contracts entered into, the domestic content must exceed 60 percent. For rolling stock contracts entered into, the applicable domestic content percentage under 49 U.S.C. § 5323(j)(2)(C) will be based on the scheduled delivery date of the first production vehicle (i.e., the first vehicle intended to carry passengers in revenue service), final acceptance notwithstanding. Thus, if a recipient or group of recipients as part of a joint procurement enter into a contract for rolling stock, then the new FAST Act provisions applicable for the date of delivery of the first production vehicle shall apply. Accordingly, if the first production vehicle is delivered in FY2018 or FY2019, the domestic content must be more than 65 percent, and if the first production vehicle is delivered in FY2020 or beyond, the domestic content must be more than 70 percent. If the scheduled delivery date is delayed such that the domestic content requirement is increased, recipients must comply with FTA's policy guidance on the implementation of the phased increase in domestic content.\n\nCompliance with FMVSS: The recipient must receive a certification from the vehicle manufacturer at the pre-award stage that the vehicles being procured comply with FMVSS issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (49 CFR Part 571).\n\nPost Delivery Audits and Certifications\n\nCompliance with purchaser's specifications: The recipient must complete a post-delivery purchaser's requirements certification verifying that the buses delivered meet the contract specifications. This must be completed before a bus title is transferred to the recipient or before a bus is placed into revenue service, whichever is first. The post-delivery certification is based on the recipient's visual inspections and road tests and, if required, the resident inspector's monitoring of the final assembly process and final report of manufacturing activities. The requirement to conduct an audit for compliance with purchaser's requirements and complete a certification applies to all purchases of revenue rolling stock, even those below the Federal Simplified Acquisition Threshold.\n\nRecipients are required to have a resident inspector during final assembly process if they meet the following criteria:\n• Recipient is purchasing any number of rail vehicles.\n• Recipient is in an urbanized area with a population of more than 200,000 and is purchasing more than 10 buses.\n• Recipient is in an area with a population of 200,000 or less and is purchasing more than 20 buses.\n\nFTA does not require in-plant inspectors for unmodified vans manufactured by the automobile companies. FTA requires only a visual inspection and road test after delivery for such procurements.\n\nIn the case of consolidated procurements on behalf of multiple subrecipients, the in-plant inspection requirement is triggered only if any single subrecipient will receive more than 10 or more than 20 vehicles, depending on area size. One in-plant inspector can meet the requirement for multiple recipients. The inspector may not be an agent or employee of the manufacturer. The inspector must prepare a report providing accurate records of all vehicle construction activities and summarize how the construction and operational characteristics of the vehicles met (or did not meet) the contract specifications.\n\nCompliance with Buy America: Required post-delivery certification includes disclosure by the manufacturer of the final assembly location; a listing of the component and subcomponent parts, the cost (actual or percent of total) of such components and subcomponents and the country of origin; a description of final assembly activities; and the cost of final assembly. Final assembly costs are not to be included when calculating the percent of domestic content of the vehicle.\n\nThe recipient or an independent third party must conduct the Buy America audits. The audit may be based on information provided by the manufacturer; however, certification by the manufacturer is not adequate.\n\nCompliance with FMVSS: The recipient must complete, at the post-delivery stage, a certification that the recipient has received from the vehicle manufacturer at both the pre-award and post-delivery stages a copy of the manufacturer's self-certification information that the vehicle complies with the FMVSS issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (49 CFR Part 571). The requirement to conduct an audit for compliance with FMVSS and complete a certification applies to all purchases of revenue rolling stock, even those below the Federal Simplified Acquisition Threshold.",

The running tally will also enable the recipient to make informed decisions concerning goals to be advertised according to the recipient's established contract goal-setting process.

Additionally, in their overall goal submission, recipients must include the projection of the portions of the overall goal they expect to meet through race-neutral means and the basis for that projection. If a recipient projects meeting part of their goal through race-neutral means and the remainder through contract goals, they must maintain data separately on DBE achievements in those contracts with and without contract goals, respectively.\n\nRecipient DBE programs must include an element for fostering small business participation. This element must include provisions to structure contracting requirements to facilitate competition by small business (not based on race or sex). Recipients must take all reasonable steps to eliminate obstacles to small business participation, including unnecessary and unjustified bundling of contracts that may preclude small business participation in procurements as prime contractors or subcontractors.\n\nAs part of this program element, recipients may include, but are not limited to, the following strategies:\n• Establishing a race-neutral small business set-aside for prime contracts under a stated amount (e.g.$1 million).\n• In multi-year design-build contracts or other large contracts (e.g., for \"megaprojects\"), requiring bidders on the prime contract to specify elements of the contract or specific subcontracts that are of a size that small businesses, including DBEs, can reasonably perform.\n• On prime contracts not having DBE contract goals, requiring the prime contractor to provide subcontracting opportunities of a size that small businesses, including DBEs, can reasonably perform, rather than self-performing all the work involved.\n• Identifying alternative acquisition strategies and structuring procurements to facilitate the ability of consortia or joint ventures consisting of small businesses, including DBEs, to compete for and perform prime contracts.\n• To meet the race-neutral portion of the overall agency goal, ensuring that a reasonable number of prime contracts are of a size that small businesses, including DBEs, can reasonably perform.",

FTA's List of Eligible Transit Vehicle Manufacturers is located at https://www.transit.dot.gov/regulations-and-guidance/civil-rights-ada/eligible-transit-vehicle-manufacturers.\n\nTransit vehicle manufacturer means any manufacturer whose primary business purpose is to manufacture vehicles specifically built for public mass transportation. Such vehicles include, but are not limited to: buses, rail cars, trolleys, ferries, and vehicles manufactured specifically for paratransit purposes. Producers of vehicles that receive post-production alterations or retrofitting to be used for public transportation purposes (e.g., so-called cutaway vehicles, vans customized for service to people with disabilities) are also considered transit vehicle manufacturers. Businesses that manufacture, mass-produce, or distribute vehicles solely for personal use and for sale \"off the lot\" are not considered transit vehicle manufacturers.",

          "detailed_explanation": "Investigations by the Office of Inspector General have raised concerns about the administration of DBE programs. Recipients must have a process to monitor contractors for compliance with applicable DBE requirements. Recipients must implement appropriate mechanisms to ensure compliance with the DBE program by all program participants (i.e., applying legal and contract remedies available under Federal, state, and local laws). These mechanisms must be set forth in the recipient's DBE program.\n\nFor all contracts that have subcontractors, recipients must have mechanisms in place to monitor compliance with prompt payment to subcontractors and inclusion of required clauses in subcontracts. They must also be able to verify the commercially useful function of DBEs on all projects so that accurate reporting can be accomplished, including reporting for race-neutral achievements.\n\nFor contracts with a DBE goal, a recipient must also include a monitoring and enforcement mechanism to ensure that work committed to DBEs at contract award is actually performed by DBEs. Monitoring is important for both race-conscious and race-neutral contracts to ensure accurate counting for required semi-annual reports.\n\nPrior to awarding a contract with a DBE goal to a contractor, the recipient is required to collect from the awardee:\n• The names and addresses of DBE firms that will participate in the contract\n• A description of the work that each DBE will perform\n• The dollar amount of the participation of each DBE firm participating\n• Written documentation of the bidder/offeror's commitment to use the DBE subcontractor whose participation it submits to meet a contract goal\n• Written confirmation from the DBE that it is participating in the contract as provided in the prime contractor's commitment\n\nThis information forms the DBE commitment (not goal) of the awarded contract. The recipient should document efforts to monitor that primes are maintaining their commitments to use the DBEs noted in contract award documents for the types and dollar amounts of work detailed.\n\n• Additionally, recipients are required to: Include a written certification that it has reviewed contracting records and monitored work sites to ensure DBEs are performing the work committed to them and that DBEs are performing a commercially useful function by retaining control of the work performed. The monitoring to which this paragraph refers may be conducted in conjunction with monitoring of contract performance for other purposes (e.g., close-out reviews for a contract).\n\n• Require that a prime contractor not terminate or substitute a DBE subcontractor listed on a contract with a DBE goal without good cause and prior written consent from the recipient.\n\nDetails on what constitutes good cause are contained in 49 CFR 26.53(f). A recipient's written consent can only be given after the contractor notifies the DBE (with a copy of the notice to the recipient) in writing of its intent to request substitution or termination and allows the DBE five days to respond. Recipients must also require the prime contractor to make good faith efforts to find another DBE subcontractor to substitute for the original DBE. If the recipient requests documentation under this provision, the contractor shall submit the documentation within 7 days, which may be extended for an additional 7 days if necessary at the request of the contractor, and the recipient shall provide a written determination to the contractor stating whether or not good faith efforts have been demonstrated.",

During their review, certifiers determine which NAICS codes the firm is certified for, which may be different than those requested by the applicant. The eligibility letter that is sent to a certified DBE should include those NAICS codes and should be reflected in the UCP directory.\n\nReviewers are to locate the firms' information in the directory and verify that all NAICS codes approved by certifiers have been included in the firms' descriptions.\n\nConfirm that certification staff have taken the DBE/ACDBE Certification Training. This training is required for all staff that certify DBE businesses. Current staff must take the 9-module course prior to December 31, 2019. If hired after that date, verify new staff have taken the training. The course is available online through the National Highway Institute.",

          "detailed_explanation": "FTA Circular 4702.1B describes the requirements for complying with the regulation in 49 CFR Section 21.9(b)(3), which states, \"In determining the site or location of facilities, a recipient or applicant may not make selections with the purpose or effect of excluding persons from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination under any program to which this regulation applies, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin; or with the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the Act or this part.\" Locating a facility includes construction or leasing activities. The requirement for an equity analysis applies to projects requiring land acquisition and the displacement of persons from their residences and businesses. Title VI covers all of the operations of covered entities regardless of whether specific portions of the covered program or activity are Federally funded. Therefore, this requirement also applies to facilities that are not FTA-funded.\n\nFor purposes of this requirement, \"facilities\" do not include bus shelters, as these are transit amenities and are covered in FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV, nor do they include transit stations, power substations, etc., as those are evaluated during project development and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process. Facilities included in this provision include, but are not limited to, storage facilities, maintenance facilities, operations centers, etc. The recipient is required to complete a Title VI equity analysis during the planning stages with regard to where a project is located or sited to ensure the location is selected without regard to race, color, or national origin. Recipients must engage in outreach to persons potentially impacted by the siting of facilities. The Title VI equity analysis must compare the equity impacts of various siting alternatives, and the analysis must occur before the selection of the preferred site.\n\nIf a recipient conducted an analysis during the NEPA process, then this can be utilized towards the Title VI equity analysis requirement, as long as the NEPA analysis encompasses the necessary information required in a Title VI equity analysis. However, if a facility exempted from the Title VI equity analysis, due to the assumption it will be analyzed during the NEPA process, does not in fact trigger NEPA (for example, because there are no federal funds in the facility), then said facility will require a Title VI equity analysis.\n\nWhen evaluating locations of facilities:\n• Analysis should be done at the Census tract or block group, where appropriate, to ensure that proper perspective is given to localized impacts.\n• If the recipient determines that the location of the project will result in a disparate impact on the basis of race, color, or national origin, the recipient may only locate the project in that location if there is a substantial legitimate justification for locating the project there, and where there are no alternative locations that would have a less disparate impact on the basis of race, color, or national origin. The recipient must show how both elements are met. In order to make this showing, the recipient must consider and analyze alternatives to determine whether those alternatives would have less of a disparate impact on the basis of race, color, or national origin, and then implement the least discriminatory alternative.",

          "question": "Has the recipient evaluated fare and major service changes and monitored transit service?",
          "basic_requirement": "If the recipient is a transit provider that operates 50 or more fixed-route vehicles in peak service and is located in an Urbanized Area (UZA) of 200,000 or more in population, it must evaluate fare and major service changes and monitor transit service.",
          "applicability": "Transit Providers that operate 50 or more fixed route vehicles in peak service and are located in a UZA of 200,000 or more in population",
          "detailed_explanation": "Fare and major service changes: Under FTA Circular 4702.1B, transit providers that operate 50 or more fixed-route vehicles in peak service and are located in a UZA of 200,000 or more in population shall evaluate major service and any fare and fare media changes (including transfers) and proposed improvements at the planning and programming stages to determine whether those changes have a discriminatory impact on riders on the basis of race, color, or national origin. This requirement does not apply to recipients with fewer than 50 peak period vehicles, although all recipients are still required to comply with Title VI regulations that prohibit disparate impact discrimination and should review their policies and practices to ensure their service and fare changes do not result in disparate impacts on the basis of race, color, or national origin.\n\nFTA requires recipients subject to this requirement to develop a definition of a major service change and to conduct a service equity analysis for all major service changes. Fare change equity analyses are required for all fare or fare media changes. FTA Circular 4702.1B requires written procedures for the conduct of service and fare equity analyses and a disparate impact policy to be part of the Title VI Program. The policies and procedures developed to address the service and fare equity requirement must also discuss when and how a transit agency will assess the compounding effects from prior service and fare changes. (Note: The inclusion of prior service and/or fare changes depends on the nature of the agency, the proximity of the changes, and other specific factors. An agency must determine what will be a reasonable timeframe and analyze for compounding effects.) These policies and procedures require public participation during the development stages and are to be formally adopted once the governing board approves them.\n\nA fare and service change equity analysis must be adequate to evaluate if there will be any disparate effects on riders on the basis of race, color, or national origin. The circular provides extensive guidance on how to conduct fare and service equity analyses. FTA Circular 4702.1B requires recipients to use tables similar to those found in Appendix K of the circular for service or fare actions that were implemented after April 1, 2013. Any fare or equity analysis conducted needs to be included in the next submission of the recipient's Title VI Program.\n\nTransit providers may use decennial Census data to develop maps and charts until the next decennial Census or they may use American Community Survey (ACS) data between decennial censuses. These maps and charts will help the transit provider determine whether, and to what extent, transit service is available to minority populations within the transit provider's service area. These maps may be prepared using Geographic Information System (GIS) technology, although transit providers without access to GIS technology may prepare the maps in alternative formats.\n\nUpon completion of a service or fare equity analysis, the recipient shall brief its board of directors, top executive, or appropriate governing entity or official(s) responsible for policy decisions regarding the service and/or fare change(s) and the equity impacts of the service and/or fare change(s). The transit provider shall submit documentation such as a board resolution, copy of meeting minutes, or similar documentation as evidence of the board or governing entity or official's consideration, awareness, and approval of the analysis.\n\nThis requirement is different from the Section 5307 requirement for public comment for fare increases and major service reductions (see Section 5307 Program Requirements section). Section 5307 requires a public comment process before raising a fare or carrying out a major reduction of transportation service. For purposes of Title VI, recipients to which this requirement applies must perform an equity evaluation for \"major service changes\" (both increases and reductions), as locally defined, and fare changes (both increases and reductions).\n\nNote: Though the circular delineates the procedures large fixed-route transit providers must undertake when planning a service and/or fare change, all fixed-route transit providers are required by Title VI to ensure that all service and fare changes are equitably undertaken, regardless of the provider's size. Agencies not meeting the higher threshold are still required to have some means to ensure that its service and/or fare changes comply with the protections afforded by Title VI.\n\nNew Starts, Small Starts, other new fixed guideway: Transit providers that have implemented or will implement a New Start, Small Start or other new fixed guideway capital project shall conduct a service and fare equity analysis. The service and fare equity analysis will be conducted six months prior to the beginning of revenue operations, whether or not the proposed changes to existing service rise to the level of \"major service change.\" All proposed changes to parallel or connecting service will be examined. If the entity that builds the project is different from the transit provider that will operate the project, the transit provider operating the project shall conduct the analysis.\n\nThe service equity analysis shall include a comparative analysis of service levels pre- and post-the New Start, Small Start or other new fixed guideway capital project. The analysis shall be depicted in tabular format and shall determine whether the service changes proposed (including both reductions and increases) due to the capital project will result in a disparate impact on minority populations. The transit provider shall also conduct a fare equity analysis for any and all fares that will change as a result of the capital project. Public outreach held regarding the project will also be included.\n\nMonitoring: All recipients that operate fixed-route services must set system-wide service standards and policies necessary to avoid discriminatory service design or operational decisions. Policies must be set for each mode. These standards and policies must address how service is distributed across the transit system and must ensure that the manner of the distribution affords users access to these assets.\n\nThe standards must be comprehensive and apply agency-wide. Service policies are developed to ensure service design and operational practices do not result in discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin. Service policies differ from service standards in that they are not necessarily based on a quantitative threshold.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING IMPACT\nEvaluation of Fare and Major Service Changes\n\nTemporary service and fare changes in response to an emergency (including COVID-19) do not rise to the level of a major change, so a service and fare equity analysis is not required. If a transit agency operating 50 or more fixed-route vehicles in peak service and located in an urbanized area (UZA) with a population of 200,000 or more chooses to make permanent any fare media changes that are instituted during an emergency, or if such changes last longer than six months, then the transit agency must perform a fare equity analysis as described in Chapter IV of FTA's Title VI Circular 4702.1B. Similarly if a transit agency chooses to make any service changes permanent any service changes that are instituted during an emergency, or changes in service last longer than 12 months, then the transit agency must perform a service equity analysis.\n\nFTA expects that all transit agencies take reasonable measures to implement temporary service or fare changes equitably to prevent unintentional discrimination. FTA does not require a transit agency to document this process, get board approval prior to implementing changes, or share documentation on the changes with FTA, but FTA recommends that transit agencies document the rationale for specific service reductions, as well as steps taken to ensure equitable reductions in service, in the event someone files a complaint.\n\nFTA cautions that changes in fare media policies (such as temporarily not accepting cash fares, e.g., only pre-purchased media (often referred to as a cashless or cash-free fare policy)) may discriminate against minority transit riders. Minority transit riders may be disproportionately unbanked, lack credit cards, or lack access to locations for purchasing fare media in advance of a trip. FTA expects all transit agencies to consider mitigating measures in this circumstance to ensure their fare media changes do not result in disparate impacts on the basis of race, color, or national origin, which are protected categories under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.",

Prior to the site visit, review OTrak for the recipient's prior Comprehensive Review report describing service and fares, and compare this with current fare and service information received from the recipient. Conduct an internet search of the recipient for fare or service changes. Review recipient responses regarding fare or service changes implemented since last the Title VI Program submission. Ask the FTA regional office if there have been any fare or major service changes since the last Comprehensive Review. Review documentation related to any service and fare technical assistance provided by FTA. If fare or major service changes have occurred but equity analyses have not been conducted at the planning stage, discuss onsite the reason(s) for this with the recipient.\n\nFare and Major Service Changes: For the latest fare or major service change that was not included in the latest Title VI submission, determine if the required elements were addressed:\n• The recipient completed an equity analysis during the planning stages for any fare, fare media, or major service change that occurred.\n• The recipient implemented its approved Title VI Program major service change and disparate impact policy as appropriate for the type of equity analysis required.\n• If the equity analysis revealed an adverse effect or a disparate impact, the recipient analyzed alternatives and, if necessary, took steps to avoid, minimize or mitigate impacts where practicable.\n• The recipient briefed the governing body on the results of any equity analysis prior to the approval of any fare, fare media, or major service changes, and received approval for the service and fare equity analysis.\n\nNew Fixed Guideway, New Starts or Small Starts: Prior to the site visit, determine if the recipient is initiating new fixed guideway service or service under New Starts or Small Starts programs through a review of award applications in TrAMS. Determine the projected start of revenue operations, as this equity analysis is to be conducted six months prior to revenue operations. Discuss with FTA if any fare or service equity analysis has been submitted or request the information from the recipient. If not previously reviewed by FTA's Office of Civil Rights, review the Title VI equity analysis to determine if the requirements were addressed:\n• The analysis was conducted six months prior to the beginning of revenue operations, whether or not the proposed changes to existing service rise to the level of a \"major service change\" as defined by the transit provider.\n• All proposed changes to parallel or connecting service were examined.\n• The analysis included a comparative analysis of service levels pre-and post-the New Starts/Small Starts/new fixed guideway capital project.\n• The analysis was depicted in tabular format and determined whether the service changes proposed (including both reductions and increases) due to the capital project would result in a disparate impact on minority populations.\n• A fare equity analysis was conducted for any and all fares that would change as a result of the capital project.\n\nService And Amenities Monitoring: Prior to the site visit, review the recipient's Title VI Program in TrAMS for monitoring procedures and results of previous monitoring. Request and review documentation of monitoring that has been conducted since the last Comprehensive Review. Verify that the requirements were addressed:\n• Conducted the monitoring at least every three years.\n• Selected a sample of minority and non-minority routes from all modes of service provided. The sample shall include routes that provide service to predominantly minority areas and non-minority areas.\n• Assessed the performance of each minority and non-minority route in the sample for each of the transit provider's service standards and service policies.\n• Compared the transit service observed in the assessment to the transit provider's established service policies and standards.\n• Analyzed any route that exceeded or failed to meet the standard or policy, depending on the metric measured to determine why the discrepancies exist, and take steps to reduce the potential effects.\n• Evaluated transit amenities policy to ensure amenities are being distributed throughout the transit system in an equitable manner.\n• Developed a policy or procedure to determine whether disparate impacts exist on the basis of race, color, or national origin, and apply that policy or procedure to the results of the monitoring activities.\n• Briefed and obtained approval from the transit providers' policy-making officials regarding the results of the monitoring program.\n• Documented corrective actions to remedy any disparities.",

Public entities operating demand-response service for the general public or open to a segment of the general public defined by age, disability, or low income must purchase or lease accessible vehicles. Inaccessible vehicles can only be acquired upon demonstration that the system, when viewed in its entirety, provides a level of service to persons with disabilities, including persons who use wheelchairs, that is equivalent to the level of service it provides to persons without disabilities. The service for the general public for people with and without disabilities must be provided in the most integrated setting feasible and must be equivalent with respect to response time, fares, geographic service area, hours and days of service, any restrictions or priorities based on trip purpose, availability of information and reservation capability, and any constraints on capacity or service availability. Recipients must ensure that any entity using non-accessible vehicles in demand-response service operated under contract or other arrangement or relationship with the recipient provide equivalent service according to this standard.\n\nVanpool systems operated by public entities or in which public entities own, purchase or lease the vehicles are subject to equivalent service requirements. A vehicle that an individual with disabilities can use must be made available to and used by a vanpool in which such an individual chooses to participate.\n\nIf the recipient has acquired any inaccessible vehicles in the past three years, it must produce an analysis of its services demonstrating that equivalent service is and will continue to be provided to persons with disabilities, including wheelchair users, according to the requirements contained in 49 CFR 37.77(c).

(f)(1) When the cost of alterations necessary to make a path of travel to the altered area fully accessible is disproportionate to the cost of the overall alteration, then such areas shall be made accessible to the maximum extent without resulting in disproportionate costs; (2) In this situation, the public entity should give priority to accessible elements that will provide the greatest access, in the following order: (i) An accessible entrance; (ii) An accessible route to the altered area; (iii) At least one accessible restroom for each sex or a single unisex restroom (where there are one or more restrooms); (iv) Accessible telephones; (v) Accessible drinking fountains; (vi) When possible, other accessible elements (e.g., parking, storage, alarms). (g) If a public entity performs a series of small alterations to the area served by a single path of travel rather than making the alterations as part of a single undertaking, it shall nonetheless be responsible for providing an accessible path of travel. (h)(1) If an area containing a primary function has been altered without providing an accessible path of travel to that area, and subsequent alterations of that area, or a different area on the same path of travel, are undertaken within three years of the original alteration, the total cost of alteration to the primary function areas on that path of travel during the preceding three year period shall be considered in determining whether the cost of making that path of travel is disproportionate."

Where automated stop annunciators are used, the entity must ensure the accuracy and usability of the annunciators and that an alternative mechanism is available for an effective means of route identification at stops served by multiple vehicles and multiple routes when annunciators are out of service. (c) The entity must permit service animals to accompany individuals with disabilities in vehicles and facilities. The entity may ask whether an animal is a service animal and what functions it performs as such. The entity may not impose species or breed restrictions. The entity may require that a service animal be harnessed, leashed, or tethered while in public places, unless these devices interfere with the service animal's work or the person's disability prevents use of these devices. In such cases, the entity may require that the person maintain control of the animal via voice, signal, or other effective means. Note that the US DOT definition of a service animal includes any guide dog, signal dog or other animal individually trained to work or perform tasks for an individual with a disability; it is not limited to dogs as in the US Department of Justice definition and excludes no breeds of dog or other animal. Emotional support animals or \"comfort animals\" are not service animals within the context of the US DOT ADA regulations. Entities may refuse to transport service animals that are deemed to pose a direct threat to the health or safety of drivers or other riders, create a seriously disruptive atmosphere, or are otherwise not under the rider's control. (d) Signage designating wheelchair locations is required on buses. Signage designating priority seating is required on buses and rail vehicles. When an individual with a disability needs to sit in a seat or occupy a wheelchair securement location, the public or private entity must ask the following persons to move in order to allow the individual with a disability to occupy the seat or securement location: (i) individuals, except other individuals with a disability or elderly persons, sitting in a location designated as priority seating for elderly and persons with disabilities (or other seat as necessary); and (ii) individuals (including other persons with disabilities) sitting in a fold-down or other movable seat in a wheelchair securement location. Drivers are not required to compel the person to move; however, the entity is permitted to adopt a policy requiring individuals to move in response to such requests. (e) Public and private entities are prohibited from setting weight or size limitations on wheelchairs it will transport that understate the weight capacity that the vehicle fleet can actually accommodate (e.g., a policy of not transporting wheelchair users whose combined weight is more than 600 pounds, when the design load of their vehicle lifts is 800 pounds). The term \"common wheelchair,\" was deleted from 49 CFR Part 37 effective October 19, 2011. While the dimensions and capacities required for lifts, ramps, and securement areas have not changed, many vehicles are capable of accommodating larger and heavier wheelchairs. Where this is the case, it is inappropriate to limit the size and/or weight of the wheelchairs an entity will accommodate to the minimum standards. Entities must accommodate wheelchairs according to the true capacities of their vehicles. It may be helpful for a recipient to publicize the capacities of its vehicles, so that passengers using wheelchairs can determine whether their mobility devices will fit aboard the recipient's vehicles. As long as this information does not understate the actual dimensions and design load of the vehicles in the recipient's fleet, and as long as these vehicles meet the requirements of 49 CFR Part 38, a recipient that does so is not deficient. Because the minimum standards for vehicle lifts and ramps have not changed, such a recipient may accurately report that its vehicles can accommodate wheelchairs measuring 30\" x 48\" and weighing up to 600 lbs. when occupied, if that represents its actual capacities. In those cases, a recipient may restrict service to wheelchairs within those dimensional and weight limitations. Note that the definition of \"wheelchair\" specifically includes mobility scooters, and contains no requirements for brakes, footrests, push handles or other equipment. The entity may not condition the provision of service upon the presence of such ancillary equipment. The entity also may not condition the provision of service upon information from a wheelchair manufacturer concerning the \"transportability\" of a wheelchair; all wheelchairs must be accommodated. Policies requiring riders to transfer to a vehicle seat from their wheelchair are expressly prohibited. Entities may not require wheelchair users to sign or submit waivers as a condition of accommodating them. (f) Public and private entities must not refuse to permit a passenger who uses a lift or ramp to board or disembark from a vehicle at any designated stop, unless the lift or ramp cannot be deployed, the lift or ramp will be damaged if it is deployed, or temporary conditions preclude the safe use of the stop by all passengers. The entity must deploy lifts or ramps for persons who do not use wheelchairs, including standees. The entity may not seek waivers from standees who require the use of the lift. (g) Public and private entities may not deny service to individuals using respirators, concentrators, or portable oxygen. (h) Public information and communications must be made available in accessible formats, upon request. The alternate accessible format must be provided in a format that the requesting individual can actually use; which format (Braille, audio, large-type, etc.) is not specified. Public and private entities must make available to individuals with disabilities adequate and accessible information concerning transportation services. (i) Public entities are required under 49 CFR 37.5(i)(3) to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability or to provide program accessibility to their services. The process to be used in considering requests for reasonable modifications is described in 49 CFR 37.169. There is no specific requirement for a separate process for reasonable modifications; existing local processes may suffice. Whether a recipient relies on existing processes or develops something specific to reasonable modifications, there are some basic process requirements that must be met: • Information on the reasonable modification process must be readily available to the public, and must be accessible • Advance notice can be required, but flexibility is also needed to handle requests that are only practicable on the spot • Individuals requesting modifications are not required to use the term \"reasonable modification\" It should be obvious to the reviewer from public information whether and how the recipient accepts requests for reasonable modifications in policies and practices; no separate \"reasonable modification policy\" is required. (j) The key to ensuring compliance with these policies is ensuring that all employees are aware of them so that they operate vehicles and equipment safely and properly assist and treat individuals with disabilities who use the service in a respectful and courteous way, with appropriate attention to the difference among individuals with disabilities. For employees, this might be done through initial and refresher trainings. (k) Having policies is not sufficient; the recipient must also monitor compliance with the policies.",

Review the website and other public information for directions on how to request information in accessible formats. Review driver handbooks, operating and training manuals, and internal bulletins for information or procedures pertinent to the ADA service provisions. Review sample vehicle specifications and information on annunciators for how stops are announced and connecting routes identified. Review information on lift/ramp specifications for the fleet. Review ADA complaints addressing service provisions. Review paratransit information for general ADA deficiencies (service animals, wheelchair conditions, waivers, etc.). During the site visit, discuss ADA service provision implementation. 1. If automated stop annunciators are used, discuss with trainers and transportation managers whether stops are announced and connecting routes identified when stop annunciators are inoperative or malfunction, and how stops are announced upon request. Check if inoperative announcement systems are addressed during pre-trip inspections. 2. Ask managers and trainers how they accommodate service animals, and whether there are requirements for identification or restrictions on species or breed. 3. Ask managers and trainers how they accommodate needs for priority seating in revenue service. 4. Ask managers and trainers how they accommodate wheelchair users requiring the use of the securement area(s) in revenue service. Look at signage designating the securement area as such. 5. Review public and agency materials for any restrictions on size or weight limitation on wheelchairs that will be transported. 6. Ask trainers and managers how they handle \"difficult to secure\" wheelchairs (note specifically that the term \"wheelchair\" expressly includes mobility scooters), whether they require any passengers to transfer to a vehicle seat under any circumstances, and how potentially \"oversize\" mobility devices are handled. 7. Ask the recipient for a list of stops at which it does not deploy lifts and the reasons for not deploying lifts at those stops. 8. If not addressed in written material, ask whether or not the recipient provides service to persons using respirators, concentrators, and portable oxygen. 9. Discuss any request for information in accessible formats and how the recipient honored the request. 10. Review information on requests for reasonable modifications. During the site visit, request the policy for and discuss implementation of the reasonable modification process. 11. Discuss the recipient's training programs for assistance to riders with disabilities and disability sensitivity. Sample the training records for three recently hired drivers to document that the training is provided. 12. Review oversight documentation, including surveys, checklists, and interview forms for monitoring conducted of compliance with service provisions. Review employee disciplinary policies for how the recipient enforces compliance with the service provisions. Review procedures to determine how ADA-related complaints against an employee are researched and addressed. FLEXIBILITIES AND ADMINISTRATIVE RELIEF: In addition to the normal assessment procedures, review the recipient's website and discuss with the recipient and regional office to determine if it suspended front-door boarding. Review the recipient's website and discuss with the recipient and regional office to determine if it suspended its mandatory securement policy. Discuss with the recipient how it made accommodation for passengers requesting assistance. Discuss how the recipient communicated to and trained its operators on its policies to ensure continued compliance with ADA requirements. Inquire of the recipient if it received complaints. During pre-site visit or site visit discussions, discuss if/how the recipient has suspended, deviated from, or significantly updated or altered the implementation of its procedures during the COVID-19 public health emergency relating to availability of alternative accessible formats, requests for reasonable accommodations, and accommodating individuals who rely on accessible equipment when that equipment is inoperative.",

See FTA Safety Advisory 20-01. Some exceptions to rear-door-only boarding policies, however, are necessary for ADA compliance. Under DOT ADA regulations at 49 CFR 37.5(a), no entity may discriminate against an individual with a disability in connection with the provision of transportation service; per 49 CFR 37.165(b), individuals using wheelchairs must be transported in the agency's vehicles.\n\nWheelchair users are not the only persons with disabilities who may require the use of the front door of the vehicle. Per 49 CFR 37.165(g), ambulatory persons with disabilities also must be permitted to use the lift or ramp on request, and persons who are blind, for example, may require the use of the route identification mechanism required under 49 CFR 37.167(c) to identify the correct bus to board. Not all waiting passengers with disabilities who need to enter at the front will have a visible disability or be using mobility aids such as canes or walkers; per the regulation, the agency must accommodate such individuals at the front door as well.\n\nWhen implementing a rear-door-only boarding policy, a transit agency should take steps to minimize confusion for riders and personnel. This effort could include conducting outreach to the disability community through local media channels and social media, informing riders of the policy and what to do if they require the use of the ramp or lift, and development of procedures and instructions for personnel."

          "detailed_explanation": "Public and private entities must maintain in operative condition those features of vehicles and facilities that are required to make them accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities, including wheelchair users. The requirement for maintenance of accessible features applies to passenger facilities for ferry systems.\n\nThese features include, but are not limited to, lifts and other means of access to vehicles, securement devices, elevators, signage, and systems to facilitate communications with persons with vision or hearing impairments. Accessibility features must be repaired promptly if they are damaged or out of order. (Isolated or temporary interruptions in service or access due to maintenance or repairs are not prohibited.) When accessibility features are damaged or out of order, §37.161(b) requires the agency to repair them promptly. The regulations do not state a time limit for making particular repairs, given the variety of circumstances involved. As Appendix D to §37.161 notes, however, \"repairing accessible features must be made a high priority.\" When an accessibility feature is out of order, the entity must take reasonable steps to accommodate individuals with disabilities who would otherwise use the feature.\n\nAn important part of maintaining accessibility features so that they are \"accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities\" is ensuring they are free from obstructions. Locked accessible doors and accessible paths of travel that are blocked by equipment or boxes of materials are not accessible to or usable by individuals with disabilities. Agencies have an obligation to enforce parking bans and to keep accessible features clear if they have direct control over the area. This can include removing illegally parked vehicles occupying accessible parking spaces or access aisles in station parking lots, removing bicycles obstructing ramps and accessible routes, and removing snow from ramps and accessible routes. Where a transit agency does not have direct control over the areas with accessibility features, FTA encourages coordination with other public entities or private property owners.\n\nPublic entities are required to have a system of regular and frequent maintenance checks for wheelchair lifts and ramps on non-rail vehicles that is sufficient to ensure that the lifts are operational. There is no specific requirement for daily cycling of lifts and ramps, though many entities have adopted this practice to meet this requirement for regular and frequent maintenance checks. The procedures must be designed to ensure that the person discovering an inoperative lift or ramp is not a person waiting to use it at the bus stop.\n\nPublic entities must ensure that operators report immediately any in-service lift and ramp failures. The vehicle with the inoperable lift or ramp must be removed from service before the beginning of the next service day and the entity must repair the lift or ramp before the vehicle is returned to service. In the event that there is no spare vehicle available and the entity would be required to reduce service to repair the lift or ramp, it may keep the vehicle with the inoperable lift or ramp in service for no more than three days (if the entity serves an area of over 50,000 population) or five days (if the entity serves an area of 50,000 or less population). After these times have elapsed, the vehicle must go into the shop, not to return to service until the lift is repaired. Even during the three- or five-day period, if an accessible spare vehicle becomes available at any time, it must be used in place of the vehicle with the inoperative lift or an inaccessible spare that is being used in its place. In any case in which a vehicle is operating on a fixed route with an inoperative lift (including in-service failures), and the headway to the next accessible vehicle exceeds 30 minutes, the entity must promptly (i.e., within 30 minutes) provide alternative transportation to persons with disabilities who are unable to use the vehicle.\n\nOne advantage to ramp-equipped buses is that the ramps are typically easy to deploy manually if the automatic mechanism is out of order. Many transit agencies have policies directing drivers to manually deploy the ramp for the waiting rider instead of calling for alternative transportation. FTA considers local policies that direct drivers to manually deploy ramps in lieu of arranging for alternative transportation acceptable.\n\nThe recipient must monitor its compliance with these US DOT ADA maintenance requirements, including the requirements to take reasonable steps to accommodate individuals with disabilities who would otherwise use the feature and to provide alternative service for in-service lift and ramp failures.",

          "detailed_explanation": "The US DOT ADA regulations regard a system that permits user-initiated deviations from routes or schedules as demand response, for which ADA complementary paratransit is not required. One key factor to consider in determining whether a transit system is fixed-route or demand-response is if an individual must request the service in some way, typically by making a phone call in advance. With fixed-route service, no action is needed to access the service--if a person is at the bus stop at the time the bus is scheduled to appear, then the person can use that service. In contrast, with demand-response service, the individual typically must make a phone call in order to ride the bus. A system that permits user-initiated deviations from routes generally fits the definition of demand-response service.\n\nNote that the fact that there may be an interaction between a passenger and transportation service does not necessarily make otherwise fixed-route service demand responsive. Some services may use flag stops, in which a vehicle along the route does not stop unless a passenger flags the vehicle down. This kind of interaction does not make an otherwise fixed-route service demand responsive.\n\nTo be considered demand response, the service must deviate for the general public, not just persons with disabilities. If deviations are restricted to a particular group, the service ceases to be a form of demand-response service for the general public. Systems must provide information to the public on how to request a deviation. The service for persons with disabilities must be equivalent to the service for people without disabilities as specified in 49 CFR 37.77.\n\nThe requirements for use of accessible vehicles in demand-responsive service apply to route-deviation service. (See question ADA-GEN4.)\n\nIn limited circumstances, a recipient may be able to provide both ADA complementary paratransit service and fixed-route service using the same vehicle. In these situations, the fixed-route bus would go off route (or \"deviate\") only for people with disabilities who have been determined to be ADA paratransit eligible. In this scenario, service to such persons must be provided according to the same requirements in subpart F of 49 CFR Part 37 for complementary paratransit (e.g., service area, response time, fares, hours and days of service, absence of capacity constraints and absence of trip purpose restrictions).",

          "detailed_explanation": "Under the US DOT ADA regulations, all rail operators are required to ensure that each train (consisting of two or more vehicles if the recipient provides light or rapid rail) includes at least one car that is readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities, including persons who use wheelchairs. In addition, because every new, used, and remanufactured rail car is required to be accessible since 1991, most trains will have more than one accessible car. If accessible boarding is provided at a single point (i.e., as with a mini-high platform or wayside lift), to be considered accessible, trains must stop at every accessible station such that an accessible car aligns with this point. An accessible car is not usable if it cannot be boarded or a passenger requiring the station-based equipment cannot disembark. If all the wheelchair positions in the car aligning with the accessible boarding point are occupied, at subsequent stations the train must realign so as to permit boarding other accessible cars.\n\nWhere rail vehicles operate in a high-platform, level-boarding mode, devices or systems must be provided to prevent, deter or warn individuals from inadvertently stepping off the platform between cars. Appropriate devices include, but are not limited to, pantograph gates, chains, motion detectors, or, for commuter rail vehicles, between-car bellows. Some systems have had success with platform-mounted bollards, but this requires a high degree of precision on the part of the operator to properly position the train. For commuter rail, the requirement does not apply where between-car bellows are provided.\n\nUS DOT ADA regulations do not define what constitutes a \"high platform.\" However, because the hazard of falling to the track bed exists wherever level boarding is used, a light rail system operating trains of more than one car where level boarding is provided is required to have between-car barriers as stipulated in the US DOT ADA regulations.\n\nAll rail operators are required to ensure that new stations comply with ADA requirements for new construction. This includes a requirement that the rail-to-platform height be coordinated with the floor of each railcar such that the platform gap meets certain tolerances for level boarding. US DOT ADA regulations provide for exceptions to this requirement for commuter and light rail if it is not structurally or operationally feasible to provide level boarding, and the recipient lists alternate methods of boarding that may be used. There is no such exception for rapid rail; all newly constructed rapid rail stations must provide level-entry boarding within the gap tolerances prescribed for each type of vehicle in 49 CFR Part 38. If commuter or light rail stations are constructed without level boarding, and the structural and/or operational infeasibilities have not been documented for each, the recipient may be in violation of the US DOT ADA regulations. Further, if a rail operator undertakes any alterations to a station, those alterations must also be accessible per the US DOT ADA standards.\n\nNew and altered commuter and intercity rail stations must provide level boarding or an effective means of providing accessible boarding to each accessible car in each train. The performance standard of 49 CFR 37.42 requires that passengers with disabilities have access to all accessible cars available to passengers without disabilities in each train using a station. If all wheelchair locations are occupied by other wheelchair users in cars where the doors normally open at a station, FTA expects the rail operator to double-stop, reposition a portable wayside lift, or deploy car-borne lifts or move a lift, where necessary, in order to provide transportation to a wheelchair user in an unoccupied wheelchair location.",

          "detailed_explanation": "Ferry service is covered by 49 CFR Part 39, \"Transportation for Individuals with Disabilities: Passenger Vessels,\" which became effective November 10, 2010. This rule prohibits owners and operators of passenger vessels, including U.S. and foreign-flag vessels, from discriminating against passengers on the basis of disability; requires vessels and related facilities to be accessible; and requires owners and operators of vessels to take steps to accommodate passengers with disabilities.\n\nAccessibility of landside facilities are addressed by Subpart D. Subpart E, which addresses the accessibility of the vessels themselves, is reserved until the U.S. Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board issues applicable standards, and such standards are incorporated into the US DOT ADA regulations. Requirements for assistance and services to passengers with disabilities are contained in Subpart F.\n\nPassenger vessel operators are required to make a designated complaints resolution official (CRO) available for contact on each vessel and at each terminal. The CRO may be available in-person or via telephone. If a telephone link is used, text telephone (TTY) or telecommunications relay service (TRS) must be available so that persons with hearing impairments are able to communicate readily with the CRO.\n\nThe CRO must have the authority to make dispositive resolution of complaints on the entity's behalf, including the power to overrule the decisions of any other personnel (but cannot countermand a decision of the master of the vessel with respect to safety matters). In any situation in which any person complains or raises concern with the entity's personnel about discrimination, policies, or services with respect to passengers with a disability, and personnel do not immediately resolve the issue to the passenger's satisfaction or do not provide a requested accommodation, the entity's personnel must immediately inform the passenger of the right to contact a CRO and the location and/or phone number of the available CRO.\n\nPublic operators of passenger vessels are required to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when necessary to accommodate individuals with disabilities, unless they can demonstrate that making such modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service.\n\nPassenger vessel operators may not limit the number of persons with disabilities on a vessel, require medical documentation, or require advance notice, and may not require a passenger with a disability to travel with another person, subject passengers with disabilities to restrictions that do not apply to other passengers, or impose higher fares, surcharges or other fees.\n\nIf a passenger vessel operator provides, contracts for, or otherwise arranges for transportation to and from a passenger vessel, the entity must ensure that the transfer service is accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities.\n\nThe entity must provide assistance requested by or on behalf of a passenger with a disability in moving between the terminal entrance or other vehicle drop-off point and the location where passengers board and disembark from the vessel. This includes assistance in accessing key functional areas of the terminal, such as ticket counters and baggage checking/claim areas.\n\nPassenger vessel operators are required to promptly provide assistance to passengers with disabilities who are not able to get on or off a vessel without assistance and may use any means to which the passenger consents (such as lifts, ramps, boarding chairs, or assistance by vessel personnel). However, the entity cannot require a passenger with a disability to accept assistance if he or she is readily able to get on or off of the vessel independently.\n\nPassenger vessel operators must permit individuals with mobility disabilities to use power and manual wheelchairs and other mobility aids such as walkers, crutches, canes, braces, or similar devices in any areas that are open to pedestrian use. In addition, the entity must also make reasonable modifications to its policies, practices, or procedures to permit the use of other powered mobility devices used by persons with mobility impairments (e.g., Segways), unless it can be demonstrated that a specific device cannot be operated on board the vessel consistent with legitimate safety requirements.\n\nBriefings or other safety-related information must be provided through means that effectively communicate their content to persons with vision or hearing impairments, using auxiliary aids and services where necessary. This includes providing written materials in alternative formats that persons with vision impairments can use. Entities must not require any passenger with a disability to demonstrate that he or she has listened to, read, or understood the information presented, unless it is required of all passengers. Passengers with disabilities must be provided with whatever assistance is necessary to enable their full participation in safety or emergency evacuation drills that are provided to all passengers, and maintain evacuation programs, information, and equipment in locations that passengers with disabilities can readily access and use.",

The rationale that may be inferred for the statutory exemption for this kind of service concerns its typical characteristics (e.g., no attempt to comprehensively cover a service area, limited route structure, limited origins, and destinations, interface with another mode of transportation, limited purposes of travel). These characteristics can be found in some transportation systems other than bus systems oriented toward work trips. For example, bus service that is used as a dedicated connecter to commuter or intercity rail service, certain airport shuttles, and university bus systems share many or all of these characteristics. As explained further in the discussion of subpart B, the Department has determined that it is appropriate to cover these services with the requirements applicable to commuter bus systems."

          "applicability": "Public providers of fixed-route service (other than commuter rail or commuter bus service)",
          "detailed_explanation": "Each entity providing ADA complementary paratransit service is required to establish a process for determining ADA paratransit eligibility. The entity must process a completed application within 21 calendar days of submittal. If after 21 calendar days, the entity has not made an eligibility determination, the applicant must be treated as eligible and must be provided service on the 22nd day until and unless the entity denies the application.\n\nIndividuals may be ADA paratransit eligible on the basis of a temporary, conditional or permanent disability. The entity is not required to implement conditional eligibility.\n\nApplicants given conditional or temporary eligibility must be given a written decision conveying the determination and information on the right to an appeal. The written determination denying eligibility and those granting less than unconditional eligibility cannot just state that it has been determined that the applicant can use fixed-route service. As explained in Appendix D to 49 CFR 37.125, a mere recital that the applicant can use fixed-route transit is not sufficient. The reasons must specifically convey the evidence in the matter and relate it to the eligibility criteria.\n\nThe entity is required to establish an appeals process for persons denied eligibility or granted conditional or temporary eligibility. Applicants can be required to submit written notice that they intend to exercise their appeal rights. However, an applicant cannot be required to submit a written appeal, as this would constitute a prohibited unreasonable administrative burden on the applicant. The entity may require that this written notice be filed within 60 days of the denial of a person's application. The process must include an opportunity to be heard to present information and \"separation of authority\" between those hearing the appeal and those that made the original decision to deny eligibility. An individual may also waive the in-person hearing and proceed on the basis of a written presentation.\n\nThe entity is not required to provide ADA complementary paratransit service pending the determination of the appeal, but if the decision takes longer than 30 days after completing the appeals process, paratransit service must be provided from that time until a decision to deny the appeal is issued. A written notification of an appeal determination, with the reason for it, is also required.\n\nEligibility for complementary paratransit is directly related to the functional ability of individuals with disabilities to use fixed-route transit services. Eligibility is not based on a diagnosis or type of disability. Individuals with the same diagnosis or disability can have very different functional abilities to use fixed-route services. Similarly, eligibility is not based on the type of mobility aids that individuals use. Use of a wheelchair does not imply automatic eligibility, for example, since many individuals who use wheelchairs are able to use fixed-route services for many or all of their trips. Nor is ADA paratransit eligibility based on age, income or whether or not individuals can drive or have access to private automobile transportation.\n\nThe entity may request basic personal identifying information on its application forms, such as name, date of birth and home address. Collection of other information, such as income or personal vehicle ownership, must be clearly optional; the entity is deficient if it uses such information as a basis for determining paratransit eligibility. A process by which applications collecting such additional information are rejected as \"incomplete\" is an indication that the information is not optional and has become a part of the eligibility process. Note that entities that have system-wide policies requiring all children under a certain age to travel with an adult (for fixed-route transit as well as complementary paratransit) may apply these policies to eligibility determinations for children.\n\nThe entity may note as part of its eligibility process whether or not the applicant travels with a personal care attendant (PCA) but may not establish a process to \"approve\" travel with a PCA. A PCA is someone designated or employed specifically to help the eligible individual meet his or her personal needs. Those needs may or may not include assistance involving the transportation process; most functions performed by a PCA do not involve travel. The entity may not involve itself in the selection of an individual's PCA nor seek to \"approve\" persons serving as PCAs. The entity may not require an individual indicating that s/he travels with a PCA to always travel with a PCA, or deny service based on the absence of a PCA for a particular trip or trips. The entity may not require the individual to be accompanied by the same PCA.",

The DOT ADA regulations at 49 CFR 37.125 do not require in-person assessments for paratransit eligibility, and in fact do not specify how the eligibility process should work. Because a paper or virtual process is not typically as effective in assessing functional ability accurately, a transit system also may decide to be overly broad in who they find eligible, and then reassess during regular recertification sometime in the future. Note that because applicants would be presumptively eligible after 21 days under 49 CFR 37.125(c) if their applications are not processed, a transit system may wish preemptively to offer presumptive eligibility for the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency, subject to reevaluation once the public health emergency ends.

Complementary paratransit service must be provided to visitors if:\n\n1. The visitor can present documentation from his or her \"home\" jurisdiction's ADA complementary paratransit system that he or she is eligible. The local provider will give \"full faith and credit\" to the identification card or other documentation issued by the other entity.\n\n2. The visitor can present, if the individual's disability is not apparent, proof of the disability (e.g., a letter from a doctor or rehabilitation professional) and, if required by the local provider, proof of visitor status (i.e., proof of residence somewhere else). Once the documentation is presented, the local provider will make service available on the basis of the individual's statement that he or she is unable to use the fixed-route transit system, that is, the local provider cannot require functional testing.\n\nDetermining whether a visitor is entitled to service should be a fairly simple and quick process enabling the visitor to contact the host agency to learn what is required to obtain service and then being able to easily meet the requirements. This also means that upon receipt of any required documentation described above, entities are to quickly enter necessary information into any databases or systems to permit visitors to place trip requests.

          "question": "Does the recipient's paratransit service meet the ADA complementary paratransit service requirements?",
          "basic_requirement": "ADA complementary paratransit service must be origin-to-destination service provided according to the service criteria described in 49 CFR 37.131.",
          "applicability": "Public providers of fixed-route service (other than commuter rail or commuter bus service)",
          "detailed_explanation": "In crafting the ADA, Congress recognized that even when a fixed-route transit system is fully accessible there will be some individuals whose disabilities prevent them from using the system. Congress therefore created a \"safety net\" to ensure that these individuals have transportation available to them on the same basis as individuals using fixed-route systems.\n\nThe following requirements apply to complementary paratransit service.\n\nTypes of service. ADA complementary paratransit must be \"origin-to-destination\" service. The basic mode of service can be designated as door-to-door or curb-to-curb. If the entity's basic mode of service is curb-to-curb, the entity must provide assistance from the vehicle to the first doorway for customers who need additional assistance to complete the trip. The entity cannot charge individuals needing door-to-door service an extra fee as this violates the nondiscrimination provisions of 49 CFR 37.5, the paratransit fare requirements of 49 CFR 37.131(c), and the requirement to provide origin-to-destination service under 49 CFR 37.129(a).\n\nSome small entities may operate comingled fixed-route and complementary paratransit service using the same vehicle operated along a fixed route and deviating from the route only for ADA paratransit eligible riders. If this option is chosen, the agency must be prepared to demonstrate to FTA that it is fulfilling all of the Subpart F requirements. This would include, for example, ensuring complementary paratransit is provided within ¾ mile of the fixed route and is free from capacity constraints.\n\nService area. The paratransit service area for fixed-route bus service consists of corridors ¾-mile wide on either side of a fixed route, with a ¾-mile radius around the end points. The ¾-mile service area requirement is a straight-line distance (\"as the crow flies\"). This requirement obligates transit agencies to also provide service throughout a \"core service area,\" which refers to the portion of agencies' service areas where many bus routes intersect and/or overlap so that their respective ¾-mile corridors cover virtually all destinations. For smaller agencies, the core service areas are usually downtown districts served by multiple bus routes. For larger agencies, the core service areas may encompass entire downtowns or suburban activity centers. Inside the fixed-route bus core service areas, 49 CFR 37.131(a)(1)(ii) requires the complementary paratransit service to also include any small areas not inside any of the corridors but which are surrounded by corridors.\n\nThe minimum rail service area for complementary paratransit—excluding commuter and intercity rail, which are exempt from the requirement—is defined as circles of ¾-mile radius from the center of each station. The ¾-mile requirement is a straight-line distance (a radius around rail stations or \"air miles\"). This requirement obligates transit agencies to provide complementary paratransit trips from any point within one station circle to any point within the station circle of another station, but not between two points within the same station circle.\n\nThe service areas encompass all points within the ¾-mile range; where service areas extend beyond political boundaries of a transit agency's jurisdiction, this requirement obligates the agency to provide service to and from such points, except when legal prohibitions prevent service. Per Appendix D to 49 CFR 37.131, there must be a legal bar to the entity providing service on the other side of the boundary.\n\nResponse time. For any day that a transit agency operates complementary paratransit, 49 CFR 37.131(b) requires that eligible riders be able to reserve trips on the day before. For example, individuals can request a Wednesday trip by calling during normal business hours on Tuesday. Agencies may not require customers to reserve trips 24 hours in advance; this is not next-day service, and is described by Appendix D to 49 CFR 37.131 as \"inadequate\" to meet that standard.\n\nTransit agencies must also ensure that riders can reserve trips on a next-day basis on days even when the administrative office is closed and fixed routes may not be running (e.g., on holidays). As discussed in Appendix D to § 37.131, \"on days prior to a service day on which the administrative offices are not open at all (e.g., a Sunday prior to a Monday service day), the reservation service would also be open 9 to 5.\" As explained below and in Appendix D, agencies may use voicemail to accept these reservations. Agencies using voicemail or other automated means of reserving trips must ensure, however, that any eligible rider making a reservation on a non-service day for a trip to be taken at the beginning of the next service day are assured of their reservation. If there is no Sunday service, and service begins at 5:00 a.m. on Monday, but reservation hours do not begin until 8:00 a.m., it would not be appropriate to wait until 8:00 a.m. on Monday to check the Sunday reservations line.\n\nIf a transit agency's normal business hours for its administrative offices are 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. from Monday to Friday and it operates service Monday through Sunday, 49 CFR 37.131(b) requires the agency—whether with reservation staff or other staff (e.g., dispatch)—to accept trip requests from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Sunday through Saturday. Further, 49 CFR 37.131(b) requires agencies to permit callers who request trips during these hours to be able to reserve trips for any time during the next service day. If an agency operates service past midnight—or operates service 24 hours a day—this also means allowing callers to call during normal business hours (i.e., during administrative office hours) the day before the trip to request a trip at any time the next day, including a trip that would begin just after midnight.\n\nAs noted in 49 CFR 37.131(b)(4), while next-day service is the base requirement, agencies may permit advance reservations up to 14 days before a rider's desired trip.\n\nFares. Under 49 CFR 37.131(c), the fare for a trip charged to an ADA paratransit eligible rider cannot exceed twice the fare that would be charged to an individual paying full fare (i.e., without regard for discounts) for a similar trip on the agency's fixed-route system.\n\nTo calculate the proper paratransit fare, the entity would determine the route(s) that an individual would take to get from his or her origin to his or her destination on the fixed-route system at the same time of day the person was traveling. Applicable charges like transfer fees or premium service charges may be added to the amount, but discounts (e.g., the half-fare discount for off-peak fixed route travel by seniors and persons with disabilities) would not be subtracted. The transit provider could charge up to twice the resulting amount for the paratransit trip. The system operates the same regardless of whether the paratransit trip is being provided in place of a bus or a rail trip the user cannot make on the fixed-route system.\n\nSome entities operate fare-free routes or zones that are established either on their own or by an outside organization such as downtown business districts or convention authorities. In cases where a paratransit rider is traveling between origins and destinations that are both within ¾-mile of a fare-free zone, and the typical fixed-route rider would make use of the fare-free service to make a comparable trip, the comparable paratransit fare would also be zero. Entities with fare-free zones that wish to determine whether a typical fixed-route rider would in fact use the fare-free option over a paid trip should compare the following factors in their analysis:\n• Regular fixed-route fare (outside of free-fare zone)\n• Frequency of the free service versus alternative service\n• Need for transfers on the free versus alternative service\n• Walking distances to and from the free service versus the alternative\n\nSuch an analysis might demonstrate that fixed-route riders would walk to the nearest boarding point in the fare-free zone instead of boarding the nearest fixed-route vehicle and transferring to the free-fare service. It might also demonstrate that individuals crossing the free-fare zone would use the regular fixed-route system, while individuals traveling between points along the free-fare zone would be more likely to use the fare-free service. This analysis would enable a transit agency to determine whether it may charge a fare for a given complementary paratransit trip between points that are both within ¾ mile of the free-fare zone.\n\nWhere other entities such as business organizations or chambers of commerce sponsor fare-free routes or zones, transit agencies are encouraged to consider including a requirement in such arrangements that the entity also assume responsibility for paratransit fares within such areas.\n\nSome entities may operate fare-free promotions for a defined, limited period of time. While the US DOT ADA regulations specify that \"discounts\" are not required to be calculated when determining the comparable paratransit fare, the US DOT ADA regulations are silent on what constitutes a discount, other than the half-fare provision contained in the Federal Transit Act. It is therefore incumbent on the entity to determine whether a limited-time fare promotion constitutes a discount and provide support for such determination.\n\nCompanions may be charged the same fare as the eligible individual they are accompanying. Personal care attendants ride free.\n\nOne exception to the fare requirement is made for social service agency (or other organization-sponsored) trips. This exception, which allows the transit provider to negotiate a price with the agency that is more than twice the relevant fixed-route fare, applies to \"agency trips,\" by which we mean trips which are guaranteed to the agency for its use.\n\nTrip purpose. There can be no restrictions or priorities based on trip purpose in a comparable complementary paratransit system. When a user reserves a trip, the entity will need to know the origin, destination, time of travel, and how many people are traveling. The entity does not need to know why the person is traveling and should not even ask. Entities may limit subscription service to some trip purposes.\n\nHours and days of service. If riders can take a particular trip between two points on an agency's fixed-route system at a specific time of day, 49 CFR 37.131(e) requires the same trip to be available on complementary paratransit. A transit agency's complementary paratransit service area, therefore, may change by time of day and day of week when certain fixed routes are not in service. The service area may also expand and contract as individual bus routes or rail lines begin and end operation each day. If a transit agency runs fixed-route service on weekends and holidays, it must provide complementary paratransit on those days as well.\n\nPCAs and companions. ADA complementary paratransit must be provided to at least one other individual accompanying an eligible individual. If a PCA accompanies an individual, the service must be provided to the PCA and at least one additional individual accompanying the ADA eligible individual, if requested. Additional companions must be provided service if space is available, unless doing so would displace other ADA paratransit eligible individuals.",

          "basic_requirement": "Recipients may—but are not required to—establish an administrative process to suspend, for a reasonable amount of time, the provision of ADA complementary paratransit service to ADA eligible individuals who establish a pattern or practice of missing scheduled trips.

          "applicability": "Public providers of fixed-route service (other than commuter rail or commuter bus service)",
          "detailed_explanation": "Under 49 CFR 37.125(h), an entity may establish an administrative procedure to suspend, for a reasonable period of time, the provision of complementary paratransit service to ADA eligible individuals who establish a pattern or practice of missing scheduled trips.\n\nAs explained in Appendix D to this section of the regulation, a \"pattern or practice\" involves intentional, repeated or regular actions, not isolated, accidental, or singular incidents. An entity's no-show policy must therefore be narrowly tailored to ensure that suspension is only imposed for a true pattern or practice of missing scheduled trips. For example, three no-shows in 30 days would not be a pattern or practice for a frequent or daily rider. Such a policy would take into account frequency of rides and no-shows, and not use a simple number threshold.\n\nAny suspensions must be \"for a reasonable period of time.\" Suspension of service for 30 days for a first \"offense,\" for example, is not \"reasonable.\" A reasonable suspension for a first instance of a pattern or practice of no-shows might be a few days to a week. Subsequent offenses may justify longer suspensions, but FTA generally considers suspensions longer than 30 days to be excessive.\n\nEntities may not impose a mandatory financial penalty as part of a no-show policy, including charging for the fare for the no-show trip. 49 CFR 37.125(h) permits only the establishment of an administrative process to suspend, for a reasonable amount of time, the provision of complementary paratransit service to eligible individuals who establish a pattern or practice of missing scheduled trips. In very limited cases, however, transit operators and riders facing suspension have voluntarily and mutually agreed to make and accept payment for the missed trips in lieu of suspension. Where such arrangements are made voluntarily, FTA has elected not to intervene.\n\nOnly no-shows that are under the rider's control may be counted against the rider. No-shows caused by reasons beyond the rider's control (e.g., scheduling problems, late pickups, and operational problems on the part of the entity or a family emergency or sudden turn for the worse in a variable medical condition) or operator error must not be counted against the rider.\n\nFTA has permitted entities to include late cancellations in their suspension policy, but only to the extent that late cancellations have the same effect on the system as a no-show, and only for late cancellations within the rider's control. FTA has found it acceptable to consider a late cancellation as one made within an hour or two before the pickup time provided to the rider.\n\n49 CFR 37.125(g)(2) obligates entities to inform riders in writing that they have the right to appeal the proposed suspension (with an option for an in-person appeal), consistent with the appeals process outlined in 49 CFR 37.125(g). This means including instructions on the appeal process, and how to request an appeal. Under 49 CFR 37.125(h)(3), suspensions are stayed pending the outcome of the appeal.\n\nIt is important to note that 49 CFR 37.125(h) permits an entity to establish a no-show policy; it does not require one to do so. An entity is therefore not deficient if it does not have a no-show policy and does not suspend riders based on no-shows.\n\nA noncompliant no-show policy is noncompliant even if it is not enforced.",

          "basic_requirement": "Recipients shall not limit the availability of complementary paratransit service to ADA paratransit eligible individuals.",
          "applicability": "Public providers of fixed-route service (other than commuter rail or commuter bus service)",
          "detailed_explanation": "The US DOT ADA regulations specify that an entity may not limit the availability of complementary paratransit to eligible individuals by using various capacity constraints to limit service. Any operational pattern or practice that has the effect of limiting availability is also prohibited (e.g., trip denials, late pick-ups, missed trips, or excessively long trips). \"Pattern or practice\" in the regulations refers to regular or repeated actions, such as repeated denials on peak days, not isolated or singular incidents. The regulations note that operational problems beyond the control of the entity, such as unanticipated weather or traffic problems that affect all vehicular traffic, do not count as a pattern or practice under this provision. Repeated incidents caused by poor maintenance or excessively tight scheduling, however, would trigger this provision. A substantial number of late arrivals that are significantly late can trigger this provision.\n\nIn order to determine whether capacity constraints exist, entities should have a definition of ADA trip denial, missed trip (i.e., trip missed by the entity), on-time performance, and excessively long trip. The entity's definitions must make distinctions between trips it or its contractors miss (where the customer is not transported or elects not to take the trip) and late pickups (where the customer takes the trip despite vehicle arrival outside of the pickup window). Entities are required to plan and budget for 100 percent of demand for next-day service. The entity may not intentionally plan to deny, miss, or otherwise not serve a percentage of trips.\n\nThe regulations allow entities to negotiate pickup times with ADA eligible persons within a one-hour +/- window. If the entity cannot schedule a ride that is no more than one hour before or after the desired departing time, the trip must be tracked as a denial. Even if a rider accepts an offer of a trip that is outside the one-hour window, the trip must be tracked as a denial due to the entity's inability to meet the ADA service criteria. Similarly, if only one leg of a round trip can be reserved, and the rider declines to take both trips, it must be tracked as two denials. (If the rider accepts the \"return\" trip, only one trip has been denied). If the rider refuses an alternate time that is within the one-hour window, it is not a denial for the purposes of ADA compliance.\n\nThe entity may not limit the number of trips an individual will be provided. For example, the entity cannot have a policy of no more than four trips per day. Accordingly, the entity cannot set a minimum or maximum number of trips for an eligible individual. Similarly, policies limiting the number of trip requests per telephone call are considered restrictive.\n\nThe entity may not use what amounts to a waiting list. Although it may not be called a waiting list, placing callers' names on a list when the schedules are full and informing them they will be contacted if space becomes available would constitute a prohibited waiting list. Similarly, telling callers the schedules are full and suggesting they call back later to see if space becomes available would be a waiting list.\n\nEntities may accept a trip request during a reservation call and internally schedule the trip later (within the pickup window communicated to the rider at the time of reservation), which are often referred to as confirmed but unscheduled trips.\n\nEntities should have a mechanism in place for monitoring, tracking, and verifying these indicators of capacity constraints. While there is no regulatory requirement for record-keeping or monitoring in any particular way, entities must be able to demonstrate that the trip denials it does have, as well as the missed trips, late pickups, trips of excessive length, etc., are not an operational pattern or practice that significantly limits the availability of ADA paratransit service. Entities should track service for ADA trips separately from non-ADA trips.",

Where an entity relies on another public entity to provide paratransit service on its behalf, the entity remains responsible for meeting the requirements of 49 CFR part 37 Subpart F. In other words, the entity must ensure that the service provided on its behalf meets all the requirements that it would be required to meet if it provided the service directly. The entity is not permitted to defer to the private entity operating the service. The entity must have procedures in place to monitor the performance of such service to ensure that these requirements are met.\n\nFor example, if a transit operator relies on a taxi company or transportation network company (TNC) or other private entity to provide a portion of its paratransit service, it must ensure that all paratransit-eligible riders, including wheelchair users, receive service according to the paratransit service criteria.

The program requirements detail what must be included, such as designation of personnel responsibilities, a workforce analysis (including an identification of areas of underutilization), goals, and timetables, an assessment of past employment practices, proposed remedies for problem areas, and a monitoring and reporting system. Program updates are required every four years. Formal communication mechanisms should be established to publicize and disseminate appropriate elements of the program, such as the EEO policy statement. The policy statement should be posted, for example, on bulletin boards, near time clocks or in the employee's cafeteria. All civil rights programs must be uploaded to TrAMS.\n\nRecipients that employ between 50-99 transit-related employees and 1) request or receive capital or operating assistance in excess of $1 million in the previous Federal fiscal year, or 2) request or receive planning assistance in excess of $250,000 in the previous Federal fiscal year must prepare and maintain an abbreviated EEO program. Recipients that must prepare an abbreviated program are not required to conduct a utilization analysis with goals and timetables or to submit the EEO program to FTA every four years. Instead, these programs are reviewed during FTA's oversight reviews.\n\nNo EEO program submission is required for recipients that fall below the transit-related employee or Federal assistance thresholds stated above. State DOTs are subject to the same threshold requirements for FTA EEO program submissions as other recipients. A State DOT must submit, or prepare and maintain, an EEO program based on Circular Chapter 2 only if it meets the thresholds specified in Circular Section 1.4.

A transit-related employee refers to a full and part-time employee of an FTA applicant, recipient, subrecipient, or contractor who is involved in any aspect of an agency's public transit operation funded by FTA. For example, a city planner involved in planning bus routes would be counted as part of the recipient's workforce, but a city planner involved only in land use would not be counted. Additionally, count each 'employer' separately for purposes of the thresholds. Each service operations contractors' number of employees is counted separately from other contractors' employees and from the recipient's employees. If the recipient contracts service operations to a contractor that operates nationally or regionally, only count the number of contractor employees assigned to the recipient's operations towards this threshold. Temporary seasonal fluctuations in numbers of employees should not be the basis for the threshold; rather the routine number of employees should be the determining factor.\n\nReview the recipient's applications and awards in TrAMS to verify if the recipient requested or received FTA capital or operating assistance in excess of $1 million in the previous Federal fiscal year or requested or received planning assistance in excess of $250,000 in the previous Federal fiscal year.\n\nFor required full EEO programs:\nThe updated Circular also changed the threshold requirement related to the number of transit-related employees for submitting EEO programs to FTA. To respond to these programmatic changes, FTA has set an EEO program submission schedule. Programs that require submission will be due to FTA on March 1 of either 2020 or 2022, and every four years thereafter. Review the Civil Rights Status screen in TrAMS to determine if the recipient has submitted an EEO program. Request and review any correspondence from FTA to the recipient on its submission. This correspondence can include documents such as concurrence letters or requests for revisions. If FTA provided the recipient with comments on the submission, review the recipient's current program to verify that noted revisions or additions were made.\n\nFor abbreviated EEO programs:\nIn accordance with the Circular, unless requested by FTA, recipients within this threshold are not required to routinely submit their program to FTA unless requested.

For example, the narrative assessment of the employment practices may include the agency's current practices in recruitment, testing, selection, promotion, termination, transfers, layoffs, disciplinary actions, compensation, benefits, and training. The analyses must contain statistical data to document the impact of employment practices. All problem areas must be identified and a proposed program of remedial, affirmative actions enumerated in the recipient's EEO program.\n\nMonitoring and Reporting: The recipient's EEO program must contain an effective and workable internal monitoring and reporting system. FTA requires EEO programs to describe:\n• Methods to monitor EEO components (e.g., dissemination, utilization analysis, statistical employment practices, timeframe to reach goals, all identified barriers and the progress of the action plan)\n• Procedures for subrecipient oversight\n• Process for monitoring complaints (e.g., describe the tracking system, monitoring of trends, timeliness of investigations, resolutions, reporting to management)\n\nFor reporting, FTA requires EEO programs to describe frequency and results of:\n• Meetings held between the CEO/GM and the EEO Officer to discuss the progress of the EEO program and the results of the monitoring (including but not limited to, hiring, promotions, status of EEO complaints)\n• All EEO-related meetings held between the EEO Officer and management, including topics covered and follow-up actions\n\nNote: If the recipient is only required to develop an abbreviated EEO program, the requirements below for Utilization Analysis and Goals and Timelines do not apply.\n\nUtilization Analysis: The purpose of the utilization analysis is to identify those job categories where underutilization and/or concentration of women or minorities exist in relation to their availability in the relevant labor market. It is also to establish the framework for goals and timetables and other affirmative actions to correct employment practices that contributed to any underutilization or concentration. Specific percentage and numerical goals with timetables must be set to correct any underutilization of specific affected classes of persons identified in a workforce utilization analysis.\n\nGoals and Timelines: Recipients are required to set both short-term and long-range goals. Usually long-range goals, to be obtained in four to five years, are stated as percentages. Short-term goals should be set and pursued in order to ensure accomplishment of long-range goals. Short-term goals represent the net increase in minority and/or women's employment in a particular job category within the next 12 months. Short-term goals should be stated as both actual numbers and percentages and should be based on anticipated job openings, job group availability, and the long-range goals. If the goals that were set in the previous submission were not met, there is an obligation to explain what efforts were taken to meet the goal and fully explain and justify why the goal was not met.",

Emergency Preparedness Planning and Operation: Recipients are allowed to transport their employees, other transit systems' employees, transit management officials, transit contractors and bidders, government officials and their contractors, and official guests for emergency preparedness planning and operations.\n\n4. Section 5310, 5311, 5316, and 5317 Recipients: The prohibitions do not apply to recipients that use Federal financial assistance from FTA for program purposes, that is, transportation that serves the needs of either human service agencies or targeted populations (elderly, individuals with disabilities) under Section 5310, 5311, 5316, or 5317. \"Program purposes\" does not include exclusive service for other groups formed for purposes unrelated to the special needs of the identified targeted populations.\n\n5. Emergency Response: Recipients are allowed to provide service for up to 45 days for actions directly responding to an emergency declared by the president, governor, or mayor or in an emergency requiring immediate action prior to a formal declaration.\n\n6. Recipients in Non-Urbanized Areas: Recipients in non-urbanized areas may transport employees, other transit systems' employees, transit management officials, and transit contractors and bidders to or from transit training outside its geographic service area.\n\nExceptions are considered charter service and have administrative, record-keeping, and reporting requirements. The charter regulation treats as exceptions the following community-based charter services included in the below table. The recipient must retain records of each charter service provided for at least three years. Charter service hours include time spent transporting passengers, time spent waiting for passengers, and \"deadhead\" hours (time spent getting from the garage to the origin of the trip and then the time spent from trip's ending destination back to the garage).\n\nCHARTER SERVICE EXCEPTIONS\n\n1. Government officials on official government business: No notification to registered charter providers (unless the recipient exceeds 80 hours per year and has not petitioned the Administrator for additional charter service hours); Yes to trip record keeping; Yes to quarterly reporting. Other Requirements: If additional charter service hours are needed (beyond the 80 annual service hours allowed), the recipient must petition the Administrator. The petition must include: Date and description of the official government event and the number of charter service hours requested; Explanation of why registered charter providers in the geographic service area cannot perform the service (e.g., equipment, time constraints, or other extenuating circumstances); Evidence that the recipient has sent the request for additional hours to registered charter providers in its geographic service area.\n\n2. Qualified Human Service Organization (QHSO): No notification to registered charter providers; Yes to trip record keeping; Yes to quarterly reporting. Other Requirements: Evidence that QHSO receives funding, directly or indirectly, from the programs listed in Appendix A of the charter regulation or was registered at least 60 days before the date of the first request.\n\n3. Leasing FTA-funded equipment and drivers: No notification to registered charter providers; Yes to trip record keeping; Yes to quarterly reporting. Other Requirements: Evidence that registered charter providers have exhausted all of the available vehicles of all registered charter providers in the recipient's geographic service area.\n\n4. When no registered charter provider responds to notice from a recipient: Yes to notification to registered charter providers; Yes to trip record keeping; Yes to quarterly reporting. Other Requirements: None.\n\n5. Agreement with registered charter providers: Yes to notification (if a newly registered charter provider joined the UZA after the initial agreement); No to trip record keeping; No to quarterly reporting. Other Requirements: Properly executed agreements with all registered charter providers in recipient's geographic service area.\n\n6. Petitions to the Administrator: Yes to notification to registered charter providers; No to trip record keeping; No to quarterly reporting. Other Requirements: Recipient must demonstrate how it contacted registered charter providers and how the recipient will use the registered charter providers in providing service to the event. Recipient must also certify that it has exhausted available registered charter providers' vehicles in the area.\n\nThe charter regulations do not apply to equipment that is solely funded with local funds, is stored in a locally-funded facility, and is maintained only with local funds. A complete segregation is necessary to avoid the application of these requirements to charter services operated with locally-owned vehicles.\n\nFLEXIBILITIES AND ADMINISTRATIVE RELIEF\n\nUnder Charter Bus Exemption #5 Emergency Response, recipients are allowed to provide service for up to 45 days for actions directly responding to an emergency declared by the president, governor, or mayor or in an emergency requiring immediate action prior to a formal declaration. If a recipient intends to provide charter bus service beyond the 45-day period, it must seek FTA approval through the Emergency Relief Docket.",

The required minimum rate for random alcohol testing is 10 percent.\n\nThe following checklist identifies the minimum requirements of a drug and alcohol testing policy as defined by 49 CFR 655.15, only reviewed during the Triennial/State Management Oversight process\n\n(1) *Proof of policy adoption by the appropriate governing body or other \"final authority\" with effective date indicated\n(2) *Identity of the person, office, or position designated by the employer to answer questions about the anti-drug and alcohol misuse program\n(3) *Categories of employees who are subject to testing\n(4) *Prohibited behavior, including when the regulations prohibit the use of alcohol and drugs\n(5) *Testing circumstances for drugs and alcohol (i.e., pre-employment, random, post-accident, reasonable suspicion, return-to-duty (only for employers with a second-chance policy), and follow-up testing (only for employers with a second-chance policy)\n(6) *Description of the consequences for a covered employee who has a verified positive drug test result, a confirmed alcohol test with an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater, or refuses to submit to a test, including the mandatory requirements that the covered employee be removed immediately from his or her safety-sensitive function and be referred to a substance abuse professional\n(7) *Description of the consequences for covered employees found to have an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04\n\nNOTE TO REVIEWER: Instead of listing all the refusals, the policy may state that refusals to test are listed in 49 CFR part 40, as amended, or 49 CFR 40.191, as amended, for drug tests and 49 CFR 40.261, as amended, for breath tests. The policy should then state that a copy of 49 CFR part 40 is available upon request. However, if the policy lists any refusals to test, the policy must list all of them.\n\nFederal Railroad Administration (FRA) regulations cover commuter rail operations. United States Coast Guard (USCG) regulations cover ferry vessel operations. The policy, which would include elements required by USCG, must require employees considered safety-sensitive by the USCG (crew members with a merchant mariners document or under a certificate of inspection) to submit to random alcohol tests under FTA authority.",

If there was no contingent offer of employment, the MRO will cancel the test;\n\n(8) Fail to cooperate with any part of the testing process (e.g., refuse to empty pockets when directed by the collector, behave in a confrontational way that disrupts the collection process, fail to wash hands after being directed to do so by the collector, fail to remove objects from mouth, fail to permit inspection of the oral cavity, or fail to complete a rinse when requested);\n\n(9) For an observed urine collection, fail to follow the observer's instructions to raise your clothing above the waist, lower clothing and underpants, and to turn around to permit the observer to determine if you have any type of prosthetic or other device that could be used to interfere with the collection process;\n\n(10) Possess or wear a prosthetic or other device that could be used to interfere with the collection process; or\n\n(11) Admit to the collector or MRO that you adulterated or substituted the specimen.\n\n(b) As an employee, if the MRO reports that you have a verified adulterated or substituted test result, you have refused to take a drug test.\n\n(c) As an employee, if you refuse to take a drug test, you incur the consequences specified under DOT agency regulations for a violation of those DOT agency regulations. The consequences specified under DOT agency regulations for a refusal cannot be overturned or set aside by an arbitration, grievance, State court or other non-Federal forum that adjudicates the personnel decisions the employer has taken against the employee."

          "applicability": "Section 5307 recipients",

The planning regulations require that the metropolitan transportation planning process include a proactive participation plan that provides complete information, timely public notice, and reasonable public access to key decisions, and supports early and continuing involvement of the public in developing plans and TIPs. (The recipient's projects must be programmed in the TIP to be eligible for funding.) Section 5307 recipients also have specific requirements for public participation related to the POP. POP public participation requirements do not apply to funds flexed into a Section 5307 award.\n\nFTA allows a Section 5307 recipient to rely on the locally adopted public participation requirements for the TIP in lieu of the separate public-review process required in the development of the POP if the recipient has coordinated with the MPO and ensured that the public is aware that the TIP development process is being used to satisfy the POP public participation requirements. The recipient may rely on the MPO public participation process for the TIP even when notices are published less than annually.\n\nIn order for a recipient to rely on the TIP public involvement process for the TIP to meet Section 5307 public involvement requirements for the POP:\n• The MPO must have an adopted public participation plan.\n• The TIP document (public participation plan, notice, or TIP) must state that public notice of public participation activities and time established for public review of and comments on the TIP will satisfy the POP requirements.\n\nFTA encourages (but does not require) recipients to state in the metropolitan transportation planning agreement with the MPO, state(s), and providers of public transportation that it relies on the public participation process for the TIP to satisfy Section 5307 public involvement requirements for the POP.\n\nIf the recipient relies on its own process to satisfy POP public participation requirements, it must:\n• Make available to the public information concerning the amount of funds available under the Section 5307 program and the POP that the recipient proposes to undertake with such funds.\n• Develop a proposed POP in consultation with interested parties, including private transportation providers and human services organizations or transit operators representing the employment-related transportation needs of welfare recipients and low-income individuals. Participation in the public transportation-human services planning process satisfies this requirement.\n• Publish the proposed POP in sufficient detail and in such a manner as to afford affected citizens, private transportation providers, representatives of welfare recipients and low-income individuals, and, as appropriate, local elected officials, reasonable and adequate opportunity to examine the proposed program and to comment on it and on the performance of the recipient.\n• Provide an opportunity for a public hearing to obtain the views of the public on the proposed POP. Most recipients include in the public notice an announcement that the proposed POP is available for review and that, if requested, a public hearing will be held. Some local laws or recipient policies make the public hearing mandatory.\n• Ensure that the proposed POP provides for the coordination of Section 5307 public transportation services with transportation services assisted with other Federal sources. Coordination may occur at many levels, from simple information sharing to total consolidation of services. Participation in the public transportation-human services planning process satisfies this requirement.\n• Consider comments and views received, including those of private transportation providers and human services organizations or transit operators representing the employment-related transportation needs of welfare recipients and low-income individuals, in preparing the final POP. Participation in the public transportation-human services planning process satisfies this requirement.\n• Make the final POP available to the public.\n\nWhere there are multiple designated recipients and/or multiple MPOs, this public participation requirement may be met in several separate processes for the different areas involved.\n\nFLEXIBILITIES AND ADMINISTRATIVE RELIEF\nPublic Participation Flexibilities: Projects funded with CARES Act, CRRSAA, or ARP Act funds that are administered under the Urbanized Area Formula Program that involve substantial changes to the function, location, or capacity of transit system assets are subject to all Program of Projects requirements. Consistent with the emergency exemptions from the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) or the Statewide Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) requirements, all other projects funded by CARES Act, CRRSAA, and ARP Act funds, including operating assistance projects and capital projects that do not involve a substantial change to the function, location, or capacity of an asset, are subject only to the requirements associated with making the amount of funding available to the recipient public (49 U.S.C. 5307(b)(1)) and making the final program of projects available to the public (49 U.S.C. 5307(b)(7)).

If more than one recipient will apply for grants for projects in the POP, each grant application must include the portion of the POP that identifies the projects to be funded in the grant. The POP must include a description of each project to be funded from the UZA's apportionment, including any suballocation among public transportation providers, total project costs, local share, and federal share for each project. Where there are multiple designated recipients or MPOs for a UZA, the POP may be presented in several separate parts for the purpose of programming and public participation.\n\ne. Public Participation Requirements. To receive a grant under Section 5307, a recipient must meet certain requirements concerning public participation in the development of a POP and must certify to compliance with these requirements. The requirements are listed in 49 U.S.C. 5307(b)(1) through (7) and are discussed in the paragraphs below. The recipient may satisfy these requirements in whole or in part through the development of the metropolitan TIP and the local coordinated public transit – human service transportation plan.\n\nEither the designated recipient for a UZA or each individual direct recipient must:\n(1) Make available to the public information concerning the amount of funds available under the Section 5307 Program and the POP that the recipient proposes to undertake with such funds;\n(2) Develop a proposed POP for activities the designated recipient will finance, in consultation with interested parties, including private transportation providers and human services organizations or transit operators representing the employment-related transportation needs of welfare recipients and low-income individuals;\n(3) Publish the proposed POP in sufficient detail and in such a manner as to afford affected members of the public, private transportation providers, representatives of welfare recipients and low-income individuals, and, as appropriate, local elected officials, reasonable and adequate opportunity to examine the proposed program and to submit comments on the proposed program and on the performance of the recipient;\n(4) Provide an opportunity for a public hearing to obtain the views of the public on the proposed POP;\n(5) Ensure that the proposed POP provides for the coordination of Section 5307 public transportation services with transportation services assisted with other federal sources;\n(6) Consider comments and views received, including those of private transportation providers and human services organizations or transit operators representing the employment-related transportation needs of welfare recipients and low-income individuals, in preparing the final POP; and\n(7) Make the final POP available to the public.\n\nNote: Where there are multiple designated recipients and/or multiple MPOs, this public participation requirement may be met in several separate processes for the different areas involved.\n\nf. Satisfying the Requirement for Public Participation in Development of the POP using the Transportation Improvement Program Process. Federal transit law and joint FHWA/FTA planning regulations governing the metropolitan planning process require a locality to include the public and solicit comment when the locality develops its metropolitan long-range (twenty-year) transportation plan and its (four-year) metropolitan TIP. Accordingly, FTA has determined that when a recipient follows the procedures of the public involvement process outlined in the FHWA/FTA planning regulations, the recipient satisfies the public participation requirements associated with development of the POP that recipients of Section 5307 funds must meet. See 23 CFR part 450 and 49 CFR part 613 (specifically Subpart B, \"Statewide Transportation Planning,\" and Subpart C, \"Metropolitan Transportation Planning and Programming\").\n\nA recipient that chooses to integrate the two should coordinate with the MPO and make sure the public knows that the recipient is using the public participation process associated with TIP development to satisfy the public hearing requirements of Section 5307(b). The recipient must ensure the TIP document explicitly states that public notice of public involvement activities and time established for public review and comment on the TIP will satisfy the POP public review requirements of the Section 5307 Program."

          "detailed_explanation": "Section 5307 recipients certify annually that they have a locally developed process to solicit and consider public comment prior to raising a fare or implementing a major reduction in public transportation service. Recipients are expected to have a written policy that describes the public comment process. The recipient is responsible for defining a major service reduction that addresses fixed route and/or demand response service. The definition(s) can be defined as a standard, such as elimination of a route or reduction of \"X\" percent of service hours or miles.\n\nThe policy should provide an opportunity for a public hearing or meeting for any fare increase or major service reduction. It should describe how such meetings will be conducted and how the results will be considered. A public meeting is not mandatory; however, an opportunity for a public meeting in order to solicit comment must be provided. Some recipients offer an opportunity for public comment for all fare and service changes.\n\nFLEXIBILITIES AND ADMINISTRATIVE RELIEF\nPublic Comment Process Flexibility: FTA granted recipients flexibility in implementing the Title VI requirements for conducting a fare and equity analysis in noting that temporary service changes in response to an emergency do not rise to the level of a major service change, so a service equity analysis is not required. Similarly, FTA exempts all temporary fare changes enacted as a result of an emergency from the fare equity analysis requirement. However, if a transit agency chooses to make permanent any changes made during an emergency, or if changes last longer than twelve months (service) or six months (fare), then the transit agency must perform a service or fare equity analysis.\n\nGiven this flexibility for meeting the Title VI requirements, FTA has granted the same flexibility for meeting the Section 5307 requirements for implementing a public comment process on increases in the basic fare structure and on major service reductions. Consequently, a temporary service reduction as a result of an emergency is by definition not a \"major reduction in service\" unless it lasts longer than a year or otherwise becomes permanent. Therefore, the recipient must still meet the requirement of a written policy that describes the public comment process, but it does not need to follow that policy unless its service reductions lasted longer than a year.",

              "text": "Under FTA's Title VI Circular 4702.1B, transit providers that operate 50-or-more fixed route vehicles in peak service and are located in an urbanized area (UZA) with a population of 200,000 or more, must perform a service equity analysis whenever they make a major service change. The service equity analysis evaluates the impacts of the proposed service changes on Title VI-protected populations and low-income populations. Temporary service changes in response to an emergency do not rise to the level of a major service change, so a service equity analysis is not required. Similarly, FTA exempts all temporary fare changes enacted as a result of an emergency from the fare equity analysis requirement. However, if a transit agency chooses to make permanent any changes made during an emergency, or if changes last longer than 12 months (service) or 6 months (fare), then the transit agency must perform a service or fare equity analysis.\n\nFTA does expect that all transit agencies will take reasonable measures to implement temporary service or fare changes equitably to prevent unintentional discrimination. FTA does not require a transit agency to document this process, get board approval prior to implementing changes, or share documentation on the changes with FTA, but FTA recommends that transit agencies document the rationale for specific service reductions, as well as steps taken to ensure equitable reductions in service, in the event someone files a complaint.\n\nChanges directly or indirectly related to an emergency, including ridership and budget reductions, that continue longer than 12 months (service) or 6 months (fare), or are planned in advance as permanent require an equity analysis. As outlined in the Title VI Circular Chapter IV, Section 7, any major service change that lasts longer than 12 months is considered permanent and requires a service equity analysis. This timeframe applies to major service changes initially enacted in response to the COVID-19 public health emergency. Similarly, any fare change - even if initially enacted in response to an emergency - that lasts longer than 6 months is considered permanent and requires a fare equity analysis. Further, transit agencies must prepare an equity analysis during the planning process for planned major service changes or fare changes consistent with the Circular."

          "question": "For Section 5307-funded fixed-route service, does the recipient charge no more than half the peak-hour fare for seniors, persons with disabilities, and individuals presenting Medicare cards during off-peak hours?",
          "basic_requirement": "For fixed-route service, fares charged to seniors, persons with disabilities or an individual presenting a Medicare card during off peak hours must not be more than one half the peak hour fares.",
          "applicability": "Recipients with 5307-funded fixed-route service",
          "detailed_explanation": "Fares charged to seniors, persons with disabilities, and Medicare cardholders during off-peak hours for Section 5307-funded fixed-route service must not be more than half the fare charged during peak hours. If there are services such as neighborhood circulator and shuttle services with fares that are different from the recipient's fare for its regular local service, separate half fares are needed for each type of service. The half fare should take into account zone and transfer charges. Recipients are only required to offer a half fare on the single trip base fare when paid in cash or using media that pay the fare of the single trip (smart cards, apps). They are not required to offer half-fare versions of multi-trip passes or other fare media.\n\nThe requirement is applicable to fixed-route service only including:\n• All fixed-route services and non-charter service to sporting events that operate in both peak and off-peak hours and use or involve facilities and equipment financed with Section 5307 funds, whether the services are provided by the recipient directly, by a contractor, by a subrecipient, or by another entity that leases facilities and/or equipment from the recipient\n• Any express and commuter service that operates beyond peak hours\n• Fixed-route services for which the recipient has not defined peak hours\n• Fixed-route services that operate with reduced fares in both the peak and off-peak\n\nThis requirement is not applicable to:\n• Demand responsive services, including route deviation services\n• Services that operate only during peak hours, such as express and commuter service\n• Services that operate only in the off-peak hours (e.g., lunchtime circulators and non-charter weekend service to sporting events)\n• Services funded with other FTA assistance that do not use Section 5307-funded equipment or are not operated out of Section 5307-funded facilities\n\nA \"senior\" is defined by FTA as \"an individual who is 65 years of age or older.\" Recipients are permitted to use a definition that extends this fare to younger (e.g., 62 and over) persons. (FTA Circular 9030.1E)\n\nPersons with disabilities are defined by FTA as persons \"who by reason of illness, injury, age, congenital malfunction, or other incapacity or temporary or permanent disability (including any individual who is a wheelchair user or has semi-ambulatory capabilities), cannot use effectively, without special facilities, planning, or design, mass transportation service or a mass transportation facility.\" (49 CFR 609.3).\n\nMedicare is available for people age 65 or older, younger people with disabilities, and people with end stage renal disease (permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or transplant).\n\nThe recipient determines its peak hours. Peak hours can be seasonal. If the recipient determines it is not large enough, or demand is not strong enough, to identify or justify peak hour service, then its entire service should be defined as \"off peak.\" In this instance, the recipient has two options:\n1. Review ridership data and determine the peak ridership hours and develop a policy for half fare, or\n2. Choose not to determine a peak period and offer half fares during all hours.\n\nThe half-fare program, as applied, may require passengers to show proof of eligibility when they pay their fare in order to receive the half fare. Examples of proof of eligibility include a driver's license, Medicare card, special identification card, and Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) complementary paratransit eligibility card.\n\nWhether or not a recipient who issues its own special identification card as the sole basis for paying the half fare, a Medicare card must be accepted as proof of eligibility. The recipient may request a photo ID to confirm identity if a passenger uses a Medicare card to confirm identity. Obtaining a special identification card must be relatively easy. For example, though not strictly prohibited, requiring individuals to travel to a single office, which may be inconveniently located, is not consistent with the intent of this requirement. The location(s) should be accessible by transit.",

The FTA has defined operating expenses in the Frequently Asked Questions section of its website for CARES, CRRSAA, and ARP, as follows:\n\nFunds available under the CARES Act, CRRSAA, and ARP are available for all operating activities (net fare revenues) that occur on or after January 20, 2020. All three Acts provide funds for eligible expenses under Sections 5307 and 5311, but only CRRSAA and ARP provide funds for eligible expenses under Section 5310.\n\nIn general, operating expenses are those costs necessary to operate, maintain, and manage a public transportation system. Operating expenses usually include such costs as driver salaries, fuel, and items having a useful life of less than one year, including personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies. Preventive maintenance is considered an operating expense for the purposes of CARES Act, CRRSAA, and ARP reimbursement. See Chapter IV of the Urbanized Area Formula Program circular, Chapter III of the Enhanced Mobility of Seniors and Individuals with Disabilities Program circular or Chapter III of the Formula Grants for Rural Areas circular for more information on eligible operating expenses.\n\nCARES Act, CRRSAA, and ARP funding can be used for administrative leave, such as leave for employees due to reductions in service, leave required for a quarantined worker, or and leave for an employee to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, including reasonable time for the employee to recover from potential side effects.\n\nComplete the chart of CRRSAA and ARP awards, noting the percentage of projects included that do not fit within the definition of operating expenses. If there are projects that are not operating in nature, review the recipient's certification that it had not furloughed any employees after March 27, 2020. Note whether that certification does not agree with your knowledge of the recipient's operations during the public health emergency. Please note that, under FAQ CA42, a recipient can also certify that it is not currently furloughing any employees AND \"to the maximum extent possible\" CRRSAA funds will be used for operating expenses.",

Rolling stock and related activities for Section 5310-funded vehicles\n(1) Acquisition of expansion or replacement buses or vans, and related procurement, testing, inspection, and acceptance costs;\n(2) Vehicle rehabilitation or overhaul;\n(3) Preventive maintenance;\n(4) Radios and communication equipment; and\n(5) Vehicle wheelchair lifts, ramps, and securement devices.\n\nb.

Note that when lease of equipment or facilities is treated as a capital expense, the recipient must establish criteria for determining cost effectiveness in accordance with FTA regulations, \"Capital Leases,\" 49 CFR part 639 and OMB Circular A–94, which provides the necessary discount factors and formulas for applying the same;\n\ne. Acquisition of transportation services under a contract, lease, or other arrangement. This may include acquisition of ADA-complementary paratransit services when provided by an eligible recipient or subrecipient as defined in section 5 of this chapter, above. Both capital and operating costs associated with contracted service are eligible capital expenses. User-side subsidies are considered one form of eligible arrangement.

Support for mobility management and coordination programs among public transportation providers and other human service agencies providing transportation. Mobility management is an eligible capital cost. Mobility management techniques may enhance transportation access for populations beyond those served by one agency or organization within a community. For example, a nonprofit agency could receive Section 5310 funding to support the administrative costs of sharing services it provides to its own clientele with other seniors and/or individuals with disabilities and coordinate usage of vehicles with other nonprofits, but not the operating costs of service. Mobility management is intended to build coordination among existing public transportation providers and other transportation service providers with the result of expanding the availability of service. Mobility management activities may include:\n(1) The promotion, enhancement, and facilitation of access to transportation services, including the integration and coordination of services for individuals with disabilities, seniors, and low-income individuals;\n(2) Support for short-term management activities to plan and implement coordinated services;\n(3) The support of state and local coordination policy bodies and councils;\n(4) The operation of transportation brokerages to coordinate providers, funding agencies, and passengers;\n(5) The provision of coordination services, including employer-oriented transportation management organizations' and human service organizations' customer-oriented travel navigator systems and neighborhood travel coordination activities such as coordinating individualized travel training and trip planning activities for customers;\n(6) The development and operation of one-stop transportation traveler call centers to coordinate transportation information on all travel modes and to manage eligibility requirements and arrangements for customers among supporting programs; and\n(7) Operational planning for the acquisition of intelligent transportation technologies to help plan and operate coordinated systems inclusive of geographic information systems (GIS) mapping, global positioning system technology, coordinated vehicle scheduling, dispatching and monitoring technologies, as well as technologies to track costs and billing in a coordinated system, and single smart customer payment systems. (Acquisition of technology is also eligible as a standalone capital expense).\n\ng. Capital activities (e.g., acquisition of rolling stock and related activities, acquisition of services, etc.) to support ADA-complementary paratransit service may qualify toward the 55 percent requirement, so long as the service is provided by an eligible recipient/subrecipient as defined in section 5, above, and is included in the coordinated plan."

The lease between the Section 5310 subrecipient and the lessee contains the terms and conditions that must be met in providing transportation service to seniors and people with disabilities. Because the purpose of the Section 5310 grant is to provide transportation service to seniors and people with disabilities, other uses of the vehicle are permitted only as long as such uses do not interfere with service to seniors and people with disabilities. The state or designated recipient, being responsible for ensuring that the terms and conditions of the original grant with FTA are met, must agree, in writing, to each lease between the subrecipient and the lessee. Such an agreement should specify that the leased vehicle shall be used to provide transportation service to seniors and people with disabilities, that the vehicle may be used for incidental purposes only after the needs of these individuals have been met, and that the subrecipient, state, or designated recipient must retain title to the vehicle. Recipients may lease any of their assets to others on an incidental basis so long as the lease agreement holds the lessee responsible for compliance with all of the requirements the recipient itself is responsible for. Thus, the lessee must adhere to applicable and relevant terms and conditions of FTA's master agreement in the maintenance and use of the asset. For example, a recipient may not lease its revenue vehicles to a private company to conduct charter operations except to the extent the recipient itself would be able to conduct charter operations. A recipient may lease its assets to a private entity to operate in public transit service so long as the entity has been selected through a competitive process and so long as the lease agreement obliges the lessee to adhere to all of the applicable and relevant requirements of the FTA master agreement.

          "applicability": "States",
          "detailed_explanation": "Section 5311 funds are available for expenditure for public transportation projects (including job access reverse commute) and intercity bus projects for people living in rural areas. Public transportation is defined as mass transportation by bus (or rail or other surface conveyance) either publicly or privately owned, which provides, to the public, general or special service on a regular and continuing basis. Section 5311 projects may include transportation to and from urbanized areas. Charter or sightseeing service is not eligible.\n\nSection 5311 service may be designed to maximize use by members of the public who are transportation disadvantaged, including seniors, individuals with disabilities, and tribal members. Coordinated human service transportation that primarily serves seniors and individuals with disabilities, but that is not restricted from carrying other members of the public, is considered open to the general public if it is promoted as public transportation service.\n\nStates are responsible for ensuring that Section 5311 funds are being used to support eligible services. Applications generally request a description of the proposed service, including service area, eligible customers, days and hours of operation, and route information. The state must enter into an agreement with subrecipients prior to expending funds on a project that specifies the project to be funded under the award. Some states require Section 5311 applicants to provide information on marketing. States typically require subrecipients to report information on the services provided (e.g., populations served - general public, seniors, individuals with disabilities) on a periodic basis. States can observe subrecipients' service during site visits. States might also assist subrecipients in developing marketing plans and a public transportation \"brand.\"\n\nTransit service providers receiving assistance under Section 5311 may coordinate and assist in providing meal delivery service for homebound persons on a regular basis if this service does not conflict with the provision of mass transit service or result in a reduction of service to transit passengers. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) expects the nutrition program to pay operating costs attributable to meal delivery. Section 5311 capital assistance may not be used to purchase special vehicles used solely for meal delivery or to purchase specialized equipment related to meal delivery.\n\nSimilarly, incidental use of a vehicle for non-passenger transportation on an occasional or regular basis is also permitted, as long as it does not result in a reduction of service quality or availability for public transportation.\n\nIn some localities, a subrecipient receives both Section 5307 and 5311 funding to provide public transportation to urbanized and surrounding rural areas. These subrecipients should use Section 5311 funds only to assist the rural portion of those localities. Because of the wide range of circumstances under which an operator may provide services in both urbanized and rural areas, FTA expects the subrecipient to develop a reasonable basis related to the service provided, for allocating operating costs between the two FTA funding sources. The subrecipient should also apply this procedure to \"joint\" capital projects.\n\nThe state must ensure that incidental service provided by subrecipients does not interfere with the provision of transit service. The state may request information on incidental service in the subrecipient application. Along with the number of passengers, miles and other statistics, some states require subrecipients to report periodically on meal delivery and other incidental service. Some states observe subrecipients' service during site visits.",

The incidental use policy does not preclude the recipient's use of Section 5311 assistance to support the transportation of passengers by a private provider that is not primarily engaged in passenger transportation. For example, a recipient may use Section 5311 funds to support a contract mail carrier that incidentally provides intercity passenger transportation, if the carrier has appropriate regulatory authority to carry passengers. Section 5311 funds may only be used to subsidize the passenger transportation services of the mail carrier.\n\nA rural transit provider may design its Section 5311 funded services to maximize use by members of the general public who are transportation-disadvantaged.

          "applicability": "States excluding insular areas",
          "detailed_explanation": "Connection to the national network of intercity bus service is an important goal of Section 5311(f) and services funded must make meaningful connections wherever feasible. Intercity bus projects may include package express service, if it is incidental to passenger transportation. The definition of intercity bus does not include commuter service (service designed primarily to provide daily work trips within the local commuting area). Commuter service is excluded because it is considered a local public transportation service, eligible for assistance under Section 5311, but not counting toward the required percentage for Section 5311(f).\n\nIntercity service is not limited by the size of the vehicle used or by the identity of the carrier. Intercity bus does not include air, water, or rail service. While much of the public transportation service assisted under Section 5311 covers large distances because of the nature of the areas served, not all long-distance trips are included in the definition of intercity service. For example, service that provides extensive circulation within a region (in contrast to regular but infrequent service from limited points in the community of origin to limited points in the destination community) is not considered intercity service, although it may be an eligible public transportation service. Similarly, service that only incidentally stops at an intercity bus facility among other destinations within the city at either end of a route that covers a long distance, without regard to scheduled connections, is eligible for Section 5311 assistance as public transportation, but is not an intercity feeder service. The statute identifies eligible intercity bus activities, including:\n• Planning and marketing for intercity bus transportation\n• Capital awards for intercity bus shelters, joint-use stops and depots\n• Operating awards through purchase-of-service agreements, user-side subsidies and demonstration projects\n• Coordination of rural connections between small transit operations and intercity bus carriers\n\nThis listing does not preclude other capital and operating projects for the support of rural intercity bus service.\n\nService that acts as a feeder to intercity bus service and makes meaningful connections with scheduled intercity bus service to more distant points is eligible. The feeder service is not required to have the same characteristics as the intercity bus service to which it connects. For example, it can be demand responsive. Where feasible, intercity bus feeder service may also provide access to intercity connections with rail or air service.\n\nThe state is required to expend no less than 15 percent of its Section 5311 apportionment on a program to develop and support intercity bus transportation in rural areas. The requirement applies only to the funds FTA apportions to the state; it does not apply to any funds the state transfers to its Section 5311 program. It also does not apply to Rural Transportation Assistance Program (RTAP) or Appalachian Development Public Transportation Assistance Program funds. Note that since insular areas (American Samoa, Guam, and Northern Mariana Islands) can use their consolidated awards for any purpose or program authorized under the programs, they are not required to spend 15 percent of their Section 5311 apportionments on intercity bus service.\n\nThe state may spend less than 15 percent of its Section 5311 apportionment if the governor (or designee) certifies that the intercity bus service needs of the state are adequately met. The governor must certify in each apportionment year that the state does not program the required percentage of funds. The state may include more than one apportionment year in a certification.\n\nBefore the governor certifies that intercity bus needs are adequately met, the state must consult with affected intercity bus service providers. FTA has established minimum requirements for the intercity bus consultative process. Please see the Section 5311 Circular for requirements of the consultation process. The process must:\n• Identify intercity bus providers in the state\n• Consult with identified providers and the intercity bus industry\n• Provide an opportunity for intercity bus providers to submit proposals for funding\n• Demonstrate a direct correlation between the results of the consultation process and a determination that the state's intercity bus needs are adequately met\n\nThe state management plan must document the procedure to be implemented for the consultative process.\n\nA state may have obligated and assigned funds to intercity bus projects in prior years or reserved funds for intercity bus projects not yet selected. A state may also have withheld prior year funds from obligation pending a decision on intercity bus needs. In either case, if the funds committed or reserved for intercity bus projects are later determined to not be needed for intercity bus service, the state may submit a retroactive certification within the period of availability of funds. This action will permit the use of the prior year funds for other rural transit projects.",

The requirement to spend 15 percent of the Section 5311 apportionment on intercity bus transportation does not apply to CRRSAA, although intercity bus is still an eligible expense. States that allocated less than 15 percent of CARES or ARP funding for intercity bus expenses must have undergone a new consultation process under federal public transportation law (49 U.S.C. § 5311(f)(2)) if the previous consultation process concluded prior to April 2, 2020, when FTA apportioned CARES Act funds. A state's intercity bus needs may have changed since the last consultation.\n\nARP also provides $100 million to states for intercity bus transportation. The funding is for bus operators that partner with recipients or subrecipients of Section 5311(f) funds. The funds are allocated in the same ratio as funds provided under Section 5311 in FY2020.

The legislative history indicates that the assessment of intercity bus needs may be made relative to other rural needs in the state. A state certifying that its needs are adequately met must demonstrate that it has assessed statewide intercity mobility needs no more than four years before the date of the certification. The state must document in the state management plan (SMP) its consultation process and any process that it develops for periodically assessing statewide needs. FTA will evaluate evidence that the state has followed its process in state management reviews approximately every three years. A state must certify that the intercity bus service needs of the state are being met adequately for each fiscal year that it does not intend to use 15 percent of its Section 5311 apportionment for intercity bus service. The state may include more than one year in a single signed certification.\n\nIf the state determines that expenditure of some amount of funds less than the full 15 percent will result in needs being met adequately, it may submit a \"partial\" certification for the remainder of the 15 percent and spend only the portion needed to ensure that the intercity bus needs are met adequately. In some cases, a state may have obligated and assigned funds to intercity bus projects in prior years, or reserved funds for intercity bus projects not yet selected. A state may also have withheld prior year funds from obligation pending a decision on intercity bus needs. In either of those cases, if the funds committed or reserved for intercity bus projects are later determined not to be needed for intercity bus service, the state may submit a retroactive certification within the period of availability of the funds. This action will permit the use of the prior year funds for other rural transit projects, subject to the notification and approval conditions described in Chapter IV of this circular and consultation with intercity bus providers before certification. The governor of the state or his or her duly authorized designee must sign a certification letter addressed to the Federal transit administrator. The letter should include sufficient information regarding the consultation process and needs assessments for FTA to make an initial determination that the certification is supported by the results of the process. In addition, in its oversight activities, FTA will examine the basis for a governor's certification. The assurance the state makes as part of the annual certifications and assurances that it will meet the requirements of Section 5311(f) does not substitute for a certification by the governor that the needs are met adequately. Appendix F provides a sample certification letter."

Commuter service is excluded because it is considered a local public transportation service, eligible for assistance under Section 5311 but not counting toward the required percentage for Section 5311(f). Intercity service is not limited by the size of the vehicle used or by the identity of the carrier. Intercity bus does not include air, water, or rail service. While much of the public transportation service assisted under Section 5311 covers large distances because of the nature of the areas served, not all long distance trips are included in the definition of intercity service. For example, service that provides extensive circulation within a region (in contrast to regular but infrequent service from limited points in the community of origin to limited points in the destination community) is not considered intercity service, although it may be an eligible public transportation service. Similarly, service that only incidentally stops at an intercity bus facility among other destinations within the city at either end of a route that covers a long distance, without regard to scheduled connections, is eligible for Section 5311 assistance as public transportation, but is not an intercity feeder service."

For example, the state may provide operating assistance to a public or private nonprofit organization for the direct operation of intercity service after appropriate consideration of participation by private for-profit service providers. Capital assistance may be provided to purchase vehicles or vehicle-related equipment such as wheelchair lifts for use in intercity service. Charter and tour services are not eligible for FTA assistance. See 49 CFR part 604. FTA encourages the participation of private companies that provide public transportation to the maximum extent feasible in this and other FTA programs. Among the various types of projects in which private intercity bus operators may wish to participate are improvements to existing intercity terminal facilities for rural passengers, modifications to transit facilities to facilitate shared use by intercity bus, intercity rail, and rural transit operators, operating assistance to support specific intercity route segments, and applications of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) technology for coordinated information and scheduling. FTA funds can be used for all aspects of intercity bus and rail facilities in facilities (such as intermodal terminals) that meet the criteria in Section 5302(3)(G) for joint development projects.

For example, feeder service may be demand-responsive, while intercity service is by definition fixed route. Examples of eligible costs include marketing and extended hours of service in order to connect with scheduled intercity service. Where feasible, intercity bus feeder service may also provide access to intercity connections with rail or air service. Rural transit providers operating feeder service with destinations across state lines are required to comply with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) regulations. Intrastate feeder service may also trigger compliance with FMCSA regulations if interlining is involved (issuing a single ticket for the feeder service and the trip provided by an interstate carrier).

The PTASP Final Rule published in the Federal Register April 11, 2024, became effective May 13, 2024. FTA expects transit agencies to address the regulatory changes in the new PTASP Final Rule in their next Agency Safety Plan (ASP) annual update. FTA requires applicable recipients to certify that they have established an ASP that meets the requirements of the PTASP regulation and 49 U.S.C. 5329(d) as part of the annual Certifications and Assurances for FTA grants and cooperative agreements. FTA notes that per 49 U.S.C. 5307(c)(1)(L), this certification is a required condition of receiving section 5307 funding and other grant funding to which Section 5307 requirements apply. FTA monitors these certifications in its Transit Award Management System (TrAMS). FTA assesses compliance with the PTASP regulation through its existing triennial review process, as well as through other oversight mechanisms, using the criteria in this manual when FTA receives a report from an industry stakeholder of alleged noncompliance. If FTA determines the agency is out of compliance with the PTASP regulation and/or 49 U.S.C. 5329(d), FTA will inform the transit agency in writing of the finding(s) of noncompliance. The transit agency has 14 days to develop a plan for remedying the finding(s) and 90 days from the date of notification by FTA to remedy the finding(s). If the recipient is in non-compliance after 90 days, then FTA may restrict all 5307 grants and all other grant funding where 5307 requirements apply.",

The CSO/SMS Executive is an adequately trained individual who has the authority and responsibility for day-to-day implementation and operation of the recipient's SMS. Recipients may either identify a CSO/SMS Executive, or the Accountable Executive may also serve in that role.\n\nIf the CSO/SMS Executive is not the Accountable Executive, the individual must meet the following criteria:\n• Be designated as the CSO/SMS Executive by the Accountable Executive.\n• Direct line of reporting to the Accountable Executive.\n• For rail transit modes, may not serve in other operational and maintenance capacities, unless those functions have a nexus to safety.\n\nThe CSO/SMS Executive is responsible for the following two oversight roles:\n\n• Oversight of the safety function. Responsibilities may include:\no Overseeing safety risk management practices.\no Overseeing safety event investigations.\no Communicating with executive leadership and the Board of Directors or Equivalent entity.\no Managing internal safety audit programs.\no Overseeing safety certification.\no Coordinating with the State Safety Oversight Agency, if applicable.\n\n• Management of the SMS function. Responsibilities may include:\no Serving as the agency's SMS subject matter expert.\no Coordinating Key Staff.\no Facilitating the development, implementation, and continuous improvement of SMS processes and activities.\no Procuring technical resources for SMS implementation and operation.\no Socializing SMS activities with agency executives and staff as necessary.\no Communicating SMS implementation progress and challenges.\n\nLarge urbanized area provider must establish a Safety Committee compliant with 49 CFR § 673.19.\n\nA recipient's Safety Committee must have an equal number of frontline transit worker representatives and management representatives. To the extent practicable, the Safety Committee must include frontline transit worker representatives from major transit service functions, such as operations and maintenance, across the transit system.\n\nFrontline transit worker representatives must be selected by a labor organization that represents the plurality of the frontline workforce employed by the recipient or a contractor, to the extent labor organizations represent the frontline workforce. For recipients with multiple labor organizations whose membership includes frontline transit workers, the labor organization that represents the plurality, or the greatest number of frontline transit workers employed by the recipient or contractor selects frontline transit worker representatives to serve on the Safety Committee. This labor organization may select frontline transit worker representatives for the Safety Committee throughout the organization, not just from their membership. If a labor organization does not represent the frontline workforce, the transit agency must adopt a mechanism for frontline transit workers to select frontline transit worker representatives for the Safety Committee.\n\nEach large urbanized area provider must include or incorporate by reference in its Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan procedures regarding the composition, responsibilities, and operations of the Safety Committee which, at a minimum, must address:\n\n(1)The organizational structure, size, and composition of the Safety Committee and how it will be chaired;\n\n(2)How meeting agendas and notices will be developed and shared, and how meeting minutes will be recorded and maintained;\n\n(3)Any required training for Safety Committee members related to the transit agency's Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan and the processes, activities, and tools used to support the transit agency's SMS;\n\n(4)The compensation policy established by the agency for participation in Safety Committee meetings;\n\n(5)How the Safety Committee will access technical experts, including other transit workers, to serve in an advisory capacity as needed; transit agency information, resources, and tools; and submissions to the transit worker safety reporting program to support its deliberations;\n\n(6)How the Safety Committee will reach and record decisions;\n\n(7)How the Safety Committee will coordinate and communicate with the transit agency's Board of Directors, or equivalent entity, and the Accountable Executive;\n\n(8)How the Safety Committee will manage disputes to ensure it carries out its operations.

A recipient must make its safety performance targets available to States and Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO) to aid in the planning process.\n\n• Safety Risk Reduction Program: Large urbanized area providers must include a safety risk reduction program for transit operations to improve safety performance by reducing the number and rates of safety events, injuries, and assaults on transit workers. The safety risk reduction program must, at a minimum:\n  o Address the reduction and mitigation of vehicular and pedestrian safety events involving transit vehicles that includes safety risk mitigations;\n  o Address the reduction and mitigation of assaults on transit workers that includes safety risk mitigations;\n  o Include the safety performance targets set by the Safety Committee for the safety risk reduction program performance measures established in the National Public Transportation Safety Plan. These targets must be set—\n    • Based on a three-year rolling average of the data submitted by the large urbanized area provider to the National Transit Database (NTD);\n    • For all modes of public transportation; and\n    • Based on the level of detail the large urbanized area provider is required to report to the NTD. The Safety Committee is not required to set a target for a performance measure until the large urbanized area provider has been required to report three years of data to the NTD corresponding to such performance measure.\n  o When the Safety Committee, as part of the transit agency's safety risk reduction program, identifies and recommends safety risk mitigations based on a safety risk assessment, the transit agency must include or incorporate by reference these mitigations in the ASP, and the Accountable Executive must implement these mitigations.\n\n• Safety Management System: A recipient's Safety Management System must be appropriately scaled to the size, scope and complexity of the recipient and include the following elements:\n  o Safety Management Policy: The Safety Management Policy includes information relevant to developing and carrying out the other SMS elements. Part 673 requires the following four Safety Management Policy elements:\n    • Written policy statement with safety objectives\n    • Transit Worker Safety Reporting Program\n    • Communication of the Safety Management Policy throughout the agency\n    • Establishment of authorities, accountabilities, and responsibilities\n  o Safety Risk Management (SRM): SRM is a process for identifying hazards and analyzing, assessing, and mitigating safety risk. Part 673 requires the following three elements to establish and implement a process for managing safety risk:\n    • Hazard identification – Hazard is defined as any real or potential condition that can cause injury, illness, or death; damage to or loss of the facilities, equipment, rolling stock, or infrastructure of a public transportation system; or damage to the environment.\n      - A transit agency must consider, as a source for hazard identification:\n        o Data and information provided by an oversight authority, including but not limited to FTA, the State, or as applicable, the State Safety Oversight Agency having jurisdiction;\n        o Data and information regarding exposure to infectious disease provided by the CDC or a State health authority; and\n        o Safety concerns identified through Safety Assurance activities.\n    • Safety risk assessment – Includes a composite of predicted severity and likelihood of the potential consequences of the identified hazards, to determine if safety risk mitigation is necessary and to inform prioritization of safety risk mitigations.\n    • Safety risk mitigation – method(s) to eliminate or reduce the effects of hazards.\n      - A transit agency must consider, as a source for safety risk mitigation:\n        o Guidance provided by an oversight authority, if applicable, and FTA; and\n        o Guidelines to prevent or control exposure to infectious diseases provided by the CDC or a State health authority.\n      - For large urbanized area providers:\n        o This process must address the role of the Safety Committee.\n        o The Accountable Executive must implement safety risk mitigations for the safety risk reduction program that are recommended by the Safety Committee and included in the ASP.\n        o When the Safety Committee recommends a safety risk mitigation unrelated to the safety risk reduction program, and the Accountable Executive decides not to implement the safety risk mitigation, the Accountable Executive must prepare a written statement explaining their decision. The Accountable Executive must submit and present this explanation to the transit agency's Safety Committee and Board of Directors or equivalent entity.\n  o Safety Assurance: Safety Assurance helps to ensure that mitigations put in place to manage safety risk are carried out and working as intended, potential safety issues are identified early, and safety objectives are met. Part 673 requires Safety Assurance to focus on three processes:\n    • Safety performance monitoring and measurement. Recipients may adopt various methods to collect and use information to support safety performance monitoring and measurement activities, such as: observing transit operations, conducting audits, reviews, and assessments, etc.\n    • Management of change. Recipients must evaluate proposed or future changes that may introduce new hazards or impact the agency's safety performance. These changes may include organizational and budgetary changes; staffing changes; changes to operations or maintenance procedures; changes to service or service environment; the design and construction of major capital projects (such as New Starts and Small Starts projects and associated certifications); and modifications to equipment, vehicles, and facilities, to name a few. This element is not required for a small public transportation provider's ASP.\n    • Continuous improvement. Recipients must develop a process to assess its safety performance annually. The process must include identification of deficiencies in the transit agency's SMS and deficiencies in performance against safety performance targets. Assessments could be based on annual reviews, how well the recipient is meeting additional agency-wide or mode-specific targets, and/or how well the recipient has accomplished the safety objectives specified in the Safety Management Policy Statement. Assessments also may be tied to the annual review and update of the ASP. For large urbanized area providers, this process must address the role of the Safety Committee. Rail transit agencies must also address any specific internal safety review requirements established by their State Safety Oversight Agency.\n      - A large urbanized area provider that does not meet an established annual safety performance target set by the Safety Committee for the safety risk reduction program must:\n        • Assess associated safety risk;\n        • Mitigate associated safety risk based on the results of a safety risk assessment; and\n        • Allocate its safety set-aside in the following fiscal year to safety-related projects eligible under 49 U.S.C. 5307 that are reasonably likely to assist the transit agency in meeting the safety performance target in the future.\n      - A transit agency must develop and carry out, under the direction of the Accountable Executive, a plan to address any deficiencies identified through the safety performance assessment.\n  o Safety Promotion: Recipients must establish and implement a comprehensive safety training program for all operations transit workers and transit workers directly responsible for safety, including de-escalation training, safety concern identification and reporting training, and refresher training. Large urbanized area providers must include maintenance transit workers in the comprehensive safety training program. Recipients must communicate safety and safety performance information throughout the organization, including information on hazards and safety risk relevant to transit worker roles and responsibilities and safety actions taken in response to reports submitted through the Transit Worker Safety Reporting Program. A transit agency must also communicate the results of cooperation with frontline transit worker representatives or Safety Committee activities, as applicable.\n\n• Annual review and update of the ASP: Recipients must establish a process and timeline for conducting an annual review and update of their ASP.\n\n• Approval of SSOA, for rail transit modes: Covered in question PTASP1.\n\n• Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan (Recipients that operate rail service not subject to FRA regulations): Recipients must have an Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan or procedures that address, at a minimum, assigning transit worker responsibilities during an emergency and coordinating with Federal, State, regional, and local officials for emergency preparedness and response in the service area.\n\n• Roadway Worker Protection Policies: Rail transit agencies must include any policies and procedures regarding rail transit workers on the roadway the rail transit agency has issued.\n\n• Risk-based inspection policies: Rail transit agencies must include policies and procedures developed in consultation with the State Safety Oversight Agency to provide access and required data for the State Safety Oversight Agency's risk-based inspection program.",

This section requires each recipient that operates rail fixed guideway public transportation systems to certify to FTA that it has established a process to develop, maintain, and execute a written plan for identifying and reducing cybersecurity risks. The recipient is to use the approach described in the voluntary standards and best practices developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Secretary of Homeland Security. The recipient also is to identify hardware and software it determines should be tested and analyzed by a third party to mitigate cybersecurity risk. This requirement applies to the entire operations of the transit system, not just the rail portion.\n\nFTA is verifying if and how, recipients are developing their plan for identifying and reducing cybersecurity risks. Recipients are to certify in the Transit Award Management System (TrAMS) by correctly completing Category 19 of the Annual Certifications and Assurances to indicate their compliance with this requirement.",
